He points out that their work has endured not only because of the astonishing care they took to reflect faithfully the syntax of the original Hebrew and Greek–which enabled them to dispense with the densely entangled prose style that characterized English writing at the time–but also because of their concern to writers from Milton to Coleridge to George Eliot.

A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years,The Book of Tea Classic Editionwill enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.In 1906 in turn-of-the-century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston's most notorious socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty—and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures.

The time of the novel is the closing months of the most senselessly savage of modern conflicts. In France, millions of men engaged in brutal trench warfare are all ""ghosts in the making."" In England, psychologist William Rivers, with severe pangs of conscience, treats the mental casualties of the war to make them whole enough to fight again. One of these, Billy Prior, risen to the officer class from the working class, both courageous and sardonic, decides to return to France with his fellow officer, poet Wilfred Owen, to fight a war he no longer believes in. Meanwhile, Rivers, enfevered by influenza, returns in memory to his experience studying a South Pacific tribe whose ethos amounted to a culture of death. Across the gulf between his society and theirs, Rivers begins to form connections that cast new light on his--and our--understanding of war.Combining poetic intensity with gritty realism, blending biting humor with tragic drama, moving toward a denouement as inevitable as it is devastating, ""The Ghost Road"" both encapsulates history and transcends it.

I write poetry... I believe poetry is a primal impulse within all of us. I believe we are all capable of it and furthermore that a small, often ignored corner of us positively yearns to try it.—Stephen Fry,The Ode Less TravelledStephen Fry believes that if one can speak and read English, one can write poetry. Many of us have never been taught to read or write poetry and think of it as a mysterious and intimidating form. Or, if we have been taught, we remember uncomfortable silence when an English teacher invited the class to ""respond"" to a poem. InThe Ode Less Travelled, Fry sets out to correct this problem by giving aspiring poets the tools and confidence they need to write poetry for pleasure.Fry is a wonderfully engaging teacher and writer of poetry himself, and he explains the various elements of poetry in simple terms, without condescension. His enjoyable exercises and witty insights introduce the concepts of Metre, Rhyme, Form, Diction, and Poetics. Aspiring poets will learn to write a sonnet, on ode, a villanelle, a ballad, and a haiku, among others. Along the way, he introduces us to poets we've heard of, but never read.The Ode Less Travelledis a lively celebration of poetry that makes even the most reluctant reader want to pick up a pencil and give it a try.

Now, in this brilliantly researched, fascinating new book, acclaimed biographer Alison Weir shares provocative new interpretations and fresh insights on this enigmatic figure.Against a lavish backdrop of pageantry and passion, intrigue and war, Weir dispels the myths surrounding Elizabeth I and examines the contradictions of her character. Elizabeth I loved the Earl of Leicester, but did she conspire to murder his wife? She called herself the Virgin Queen, but how chaste was she through dozens of liaisons? She never married—was her choice to remain single tied to the chilling fate of her mother, Anne Boleyn?

Rudolf Höß était le commandant du camp de concentration et d'extermination d'Auschwitz pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.L'histoire commence en 1913 alors que Rudolf Lang a 13 ans.Il reçoit une éducation catholique mal comprise et très normative. Son père, un commerçant, ayant reçu une éducation militaire (famille militaire), totalement psychorigide, qui a commis un péché dans sa jeunesse à Paris et avec qui il entretient des rapports tendus, veut qu'il devienne prêtre pour expier les fautes que lui-même a commises. Rudolf croit en Dieu, jusqu'au jour où, en se battant avec un de ses camarades d'école (Werner), il lui casse la jambe. Immédiatement, il va se confesser à un prêtre. Le soir même, son père devient fou de rage après avoir appris que son fils a commis un « péché » sans lui en parler. Rudolf se sent trahi par le prêtre, seule personne au courant de l'épisode, les autres croyant à un accident. Or, on apprendra que c'est en fait le père de l'enfant blessé qui s'est plaint devant une assemblée de parents d'élèves. Le mal est fait : Rudolf ne croit plus en Dieu. Son père meurt peu avant la déclaration de guerre en 1914.À seize ans, Lang débute sa carrière militaire, d'abord en partant directement pour le front Ouest où il sera intercepté puis renvoyé à l'arrière car il est trop jeune, puis comme aide à l'hôpital militaire où il rencontrera un dragon de cavalerie qui le persuadera de rentrer dans son unité et de partir sur le front en Turquie.À la fin de la guerre, il se retrouve au chômage, rejeté par sa famille. Il s'apprête à se suicider lorsqu'un de ses collègues arrive et lui brandit un tract en lui disant de ne pas trahir l'Allemagne en se donnant la mort.Il adhère au parti nazi et se voit confier la direction d'une ferme avec sa femme Elsie, où il vit des journées de dur labeur, mais paisibles. Puis, après la prise du pouvoir par Hitler, il entre dans les SS, n'ayant pourtant pas les critères requis pour y adhérer. Il accède à des fonctions de plus en plus importantes dans la hiérarchie SS, jusqu'à devenir commandant du camp d'Auschwitz. Ce camp, d'abord de concentration, puis d'extermination, devient le lieu de la lente et tâtonnante mise au point de l'Usine de Mort du village d'Auschwitz. Il y reçoit l'ordre du Reichsführer Himmler de supprimer 500 000 unités par an au lieu des ridicules 80 000 unités de Treblinka. Lang va s'attacher à accomplir la mission qui lui a été assignée : tuer le plus grand nombre de Juifs et éliminer le plus efficacement possible les cadavres. Après la guerre et la chute d'Hitler, il est emprisonné, puis condamné à la pendaison après son procès où il affirmera avoir seulement suivi les ordres, indiquant d'un air naturel qu'il a supervisé et participé activement au meurtre de « seulement » 2,5 millions de personnes au lieu des 3,5 millions prévus3.Tout au long du livre, il se montre incapable de sentiments et même d'action personnelle, car sa conduite lui a toujours été dictée par un chef en qui il portait une confiance totale. À la fin, on le sent cependant en colère se disant trahi par Himmler, qui, tel un lâche, s'est suicidé, et n'a ainsi pas voulu assumer son rôle dans l'extermination des Juifs, laissant Rudolf seul responsable de ses actes. Jusqu'au bout, il assume cependant son idée du chef, en répétant froidement et méthodiquement qu'il est le seul responsable de ce qui s'est passé à Auschwitz, et en énonçant sans difficulté les atrocités commises. Son seul moment de doute survient lorsque sa femme apprend ses activités, mais, ayant été choisi pour ses rares qualités de conscience il n'accorde pas d'importance à la morale.",369,1952,French,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413128510l/94498.jpg,"5,096",4.35,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

An engaging natural and cultural history of soil that sweeps from ancient civilizations to modern times,Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizationsexplores the compelling idea that we are—and have long been—using up Earth's soil. Once bare of protective vegetation and exposed to wind and rain, cultivated soils erode bit by bit, slowly enough to be ignored in a single lifetime but fast enough over centuries to limit the lifespan of civilizations.

It is also the focal point of current attempts to understand 18th-century philosophy. The Treatise first explains how we form such concepts as cause and effect, external existence, and personal identity, and to form compelling but unconfirmable beliefs in the entities represented by these concepts. It then offers a novel account of the passions, explains freedom and necessity as they apply to human choices and actions, and concludes with detailed explanations of how we distinguish between virtue and vice and of the different kinds of virtue. Hume's Abstract of the Treatise, also included in the volume, outlines his 'chief argument' regarding our conception of, and belief in, cause and effect. The texts printed in this volume are those of the critical edition of Hume's philosophical works now being published by the Clarendon Press.

Laing'],9780140135374,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Science', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Mental Illness', 'Sociology']","In The Divided Self (1960), Laing contrasted the experience of the ""ontologically secure"" person with that of a person who ""cannot take the realness, aliveness, autonomy and identity of himself and others for granted"" and who consequently contrives strategies to avoid ""losing his self"". Laing explains how we all exist in the world as beings, defined by others who carry a model of us in their heads, just as we carry models of them in our heads. In later writings he often takes this to deeper levels, laboriously spelling out how ""A knows that B knows that A knows that B knows...""! Our feelings and motivations derive very much from this condition of ""being in the world"" in the sense of existing for others, who exist for us. Without this we suffer ""ontological insecurity"", a condition often expressed in terms of ""being dead"" by people who are clearly still physically alive.This watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the 'divided self', or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, 'sane' self that we present to the world. Laing's radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment. R.D. Laing (1927-1989), one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow, Scotland.This work is available on its own or as part of the 7 volume set iSelected Works of R. D.

But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.Waste equals food.Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being ""recycled"" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well.",193,2002,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417605547l/5571.jpg,"10,893",4.1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail.",311,2015,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417981750l/21936809.jpg,"110,575",4.03,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

Now, the book that reignited the feminist movement is back in a fifteenth anniversary edition, with a new preface by the author that brings backlash consciousness up to date.When it was first published,Backlashmade headlines for puncturing such favorite media myths as the “infertility epidemic” and the “man shortage,” myths that defied statistical realities. These willfully fictitious media campaigns added up to an antifeminist backlash. Whatever progress feminism has recently made, Faludi’s words today seem prophetic. The media still love stories about stay-at-home moms and the “dangers” of women’s career ambitions; the glass ceiling is still low; women are still punished for wanting to succeed; basic reproductive rights are still hanging by a thread. The backlash clearly exists.With passion and precision, Faludi shows in her new preface how the creators of commercial culture distort feminist concepts to sell products while selling women downstream, how the feminist ethic of economic independence is twisted into the consumer ethic of buying power, and how the feminist quest for self-determination is warped into a self-centered quest for self-improvement.Backlashis a classic of feminism, an alarm bell for women of every generation, reminding us of the dangers that we still face.",594,1991,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922920l/200883.jpg,"8,699",4.02,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas:the Blank Slate(the mind has no innate traits),the Noble Savage(people are born good and corrupted by society), andthe Ghost in the Machine(each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and pertinent facts from science and history.Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense, far from being dangerous, can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers.

The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population.The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions.

The book starts off with a poem about honey bees, followed by a poem about the animals from the forests and seas, and a poem about a pure-hearted girl and her struggles in her new life in the city. Each page is filled with amazing and vibrant illustrations that children would surely adore. Join the characters of each poem as they tell the story of a whole different world from their perspective!Wayne Gerard Trotman's Rhyming Stories, introduced by Benjamin Zephaniah, is a fascinating and lovely series of poems that parents will surely enjoy reading with their children. It is filled with lessons mostly about the environment and animals, which is exactly what children need. The different poems truly helped me see the problems we are currently facing in our environment. Each poem has eye-catching illustrations, illustrated by Nhat Hao Nguyen, which added to the beauty of the stories and helped me clearly visualize the message each poem was trying to impart. I felt the sadness in each poem as they struggled to get through the problems they were facing and even sadder knowing that these problems are really happening around us. This book not only teaches us the consequences of the irresponsibility of mankind’s actions but also presents us with solutions to help make the world a better place. Overall, this was truly an eye-opening and awe-inspiring book. Well done!Reviewed by Emily-Jane Hills Orford for Readers' Favorite - 5 StarsAn orphaned honeybee tells its sad tale of being alone, lonely, and unable to pollinate our fruit trees or even make honey. Sad, but true, that honeybees are an endangered species. Telling the story from a honeybee’s point of view makes the tale all the more electrifying. “I’m from a land/ Across the sea/ An unhappy land/ Oh, what a pity/ There’s no more milk/ And no more honey/ In what was once/ A place of plenty.” The honeybee keeps meeting other living creatures and trying to explain its plight. It’s a sad tale, almost too close to the truth. And then there’s the story of Tun Tun, the six-year-old elephant whose greatest fear is the human poacher who threatens his family. “Run Tun Tun Tun, run Tun Tun/ I see a poacher with his gun/ Don’t wait for me just quickly flee/ Run Tun Tun Tun, run Tun Tun.” You can hear the panic in Tun Tun’s mother’s voice; the poacher, of course, means danger.Wayne Gerard Trotman’s Rhyming Stories: An Anthology of Seven Illustrated Children’s Poems is a compelling look at what we’ve done to our planet. Stories told in rhyming verse and accompanied by vibrant, colorful illustrations will teach readers young and old about the plight of other life forms on our planet and their struggle for survival. These are teaching stories, but parables too, cleverly told using the voice of the oppressed. The lyrical nature of the rhyming verses makes the stories sing their sorry tale and hopefully, the reader will listen, learn, and do all they can to change this downward trend toward disaster. But the stories are also fun, intuitive, and very insightful. These are stories about “all creatures great and small” told with both care and compassion.Reviewed by Bruce Arrington for Readers' Favorite - 5 StarsWayne Gerard Trotman's Rhyming Stories: An Anthology of Seven Illustrated Children's Poems by Wayne Gerard Trotman is a collection of seven different stories, all in one large volume. The target audience is children, and so the illustrations are geared toward that age group. Most of the stories (The Last Honey Bee, A Tiger’s Tale, An Elephant’s Advice, Song of the Blue Whale, A Letter From a Gorilla, and A Turtle’s Adventures) have strong conservation themes, targeting humans as the underlying cause of species population problems.Fortunately, the book also goes on to show that people can be a part of the solution instead of only the problem. This gives the reader a more hopeful view of how problems can be solved. The story, Mattie Boombalatty, is about a girl who is forced to move with her family because of a lost job. But the school is full of bullies and she has to deal with them. This is a fantasy story wherein a magical creature takes justice into his own hands, jeopardizing the lives of the bullies. Will Mattie stand up for them or let them go to ruin?The artwork is professional, colorful, and filled with lots of detail that will make the reader want to come back again and again. The artistic aspect helps young readers connect much better with the messages presented by the author.

On May 27, 1943, his B–24 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Louis and two other survivors found a raft amid the flaming wreckage and waited for rescue. Instead, they drifted two thousand miles for forty–seven days. Their only food: two shark livers and three raw albatross. Their only water: sporadic rainfall. Their only companions: hope and faith–and the ever–present sharks. On the forty–seventh day, mere skeletons close to death, Zamperini and pilot Russell Phillips spotted land–and were captured by the Japanese. Thus began more than two years of torture and humiliation as a prisoner of war.Zamperini was threatened with beheading, subject to medical experiments, routinely beaten, hidden in a secret interrogation facility, starved and forced into slave labour, and was the constant victim of a brutal prison guard nicknamed the Bird–a man so vicious that the other guards feared him and called him a psychopath. Meanwhile, the Army Air Corps declared Zamperini dead and President Roosevelt sends official condolences to his family, who never gave up hope that he was alive.Somehow, Zamperini survived and he returned home a hero. The celebration was short–lived. He plunged into drinking and brawling and the depths of rage and despair. Nightly, the Bird's face leered at him in his dreams. It would take years, but with the love of his wife and the power of faith, he was able to stop the nightmares and the drinking.A stirring memoir from one of the greatest of the ""Greatest Generation,"" DEVIL AT MY HEELS is a living document about the brutality of war, the tenacity of the human spirit, and the power of forgiveness.",308,2003,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393217782l/363498.jpg,"3,187",4.36,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

With all the stark simplicity of a fractured fairy tale, the trilogy tells the story of twin brothers, Claus and Lucas, locked in an agonizing bond that becomes a gripping allegory of the forces that have divided ""brothers"" in much of Europe since World War II. Kristof's postmodern saga begins with The Notebook, in which the brothers are children, lost in a country torn apart by conflict, who must learn every trick of evil and cruelty merely to survive. In The Proof, Lucas is challenging to prove his own identity and the existence of his missing brother, a defector to the ""other side."" The Third Lie, which closes the trilogy, is a biting parable of Eastern and Western Europe today and a deep exploration into the nature of identity, storytelling, and the truths and untruths that lie at the heart of them all.

Gaia and the New Politics of Love: Notes for a Poly Planet,,"[""Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio""]",9781556438219,"['Nonfiction', 'Polyamory', 'Sexuality', 'Sociology']","***WINNER, 2010 Nautilus Silver Book Award – Cosmology/New ScienceGaia theory argues that the flora and fauna of the planet operate in a self-regulating web that keeps the world livable. According to the theory, humankind is the most powerful species in this web and also its biggest threat. This provocative book explores ways to minimize and ultimately eliminate this threat with love and intimacy. Controversial Italian author Serena Anderlini-D’Onofrio has authored the first global ecology study based on an analysis of human health. Anderlini-D’Onofrio identifies her remedy within the context of Gaia theory, re-envisioning it as a more inclusive philosophy that positively impacts not only relationships, but world ecology under duress. The author links human sexuality to the global ecosystem, claiming that freedom from fear will stimulate a holistic health movement powerful enough to heal relationships and restore planetary balance.Gaia and the New Politics of Loveis bracing in its range, weaving together issues of human and global health; the relationship of politics, sexuality, and ecology; practices and styles of love; the changing roles of eroticism and gender in our lives; and polyamory, bisexuality, and the AIDS reappraisal movement.Clarification Statement from the AuthorThe argument of this book emphasizes the arts of loving as a way to help humanity make peace with our hostess Gaia, the third planet. Some of these arts involve sharing emotional resources and amorous partners.Often, the arts of loving require the use of barriers: mechanical protections such as condoms. At times they do not because only tantric energies are exchanged. The author of this book is persuaded that barriers are recommendable when sexual practices result in the exchange of deep body fluids, unless previous fluid-bonding arrangements have been made. The author is also persuaded that good practices of holistic health contribute to strengthening the immune systems of those who engage in the arts of loving.Safety practices are important in making the arts of loving healthy regardless of what factors are involved in the syndromes most prevalent today, including AIDS and other conditions in the STD spectrum. Historically, disagreement has moved knowledge forward: Today’s science is the result of yesterday’s disagreements and controversies. The author believes in critical thinking and she respects dissidence in science today, including Gaia science, reappraisals of AIDS, and holistic medicine. She hopes her readers will be open to hearing more than one side of a story.This statement and the contents of this book do not constitute medical advice in any way.

There has been much international excitement too-to date, rights have been sold in thirteen countries. Wolf Totem is set in 1960s China-the time of the Great Leap Forward, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution.Searching for spirituality, Beijing intellectual Chen Zhen travels to the pristine grasslands of Inner Mongolia to live among the nomadic Mongols-a proud, brave, and ancient race of people who coexist in perfect harmony with their unspeakably beautiful but cruel natural surroundings. Their philosophy of maintaining a balance with nature is the ground stone of their religion, a kind of cult of the wolf.The fierce wolves that haunt the steppes of the unforgiving grassland searching for food are locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival-a life-and-death dance that has gone on between them for thousands of years. The Mongols believe that the wolf is a great and worthy foe that they are divinely instructed to contend with, but also to worship and to learn from. Chen's own encounters with the otherworldly wolves awake a latent primitive instinct in him, and his fascination with them blossoms into obsession, then reverence.After many years, the peace is shattered with the arrival of Chen's kinfolk, Han Chinese, sent from the cities to bring modernity to the grasslands. They immediately launch a campaign to exterminate the wolves, sending the balance that has been maintained with religious dedication for thousands of years into a spiral leading to extinction-first the wolves, then the Mongol culture, finally the land. As a result of the eradication of the wolves, rats become a plague and wild sheep graze until the meadows turn to dust.

In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.” —Bruce Springsteen, from the pages ofBorn to RunIn 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That’s how this extraordinary autobiography began.Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as “The Big Bang”: seeing Elvis Presley’s debut onThe Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song “Born to Run” reveals more than we previously realized.Born to Runwill be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star’s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs (“Thunder Road,” “Badlands,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “The River,” “Born in the U.S.A.,” “The Rising,” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” to name just a few), Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences.",528,2016,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472979089l/29072594._SY475_.jpg,"44,763",4.11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster.What can we do better?Empathy, connection and courage to start.Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed thevalue of courage in your culture?Dare to Leadanswers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.Brené writes, ‘One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work. It's why we're here.’",332,2018,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541026732l/40109367._SX318_.jpg,"67,600",4.14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

Drawing on his experience as one of the foremost statesmen of the modern era—advising presidents, traveling the world, observing and shaping the central foreign policy events of recent decades—Kissinger now reveals his analysis of the ultimate challenge for the twenty-first century: how to build a shared international order in a world of divergent historical perspectives, violent conflict, proliferating technology, and ideological extremism.There has never been a true “world order,” Kissinger observes. For most of history, civilizations defined their own concepts of order. Each considered itself the center of the world and envisioned its distinct principles as universally relevant. China conceived of a global cultural hierarchy with the Emperor at its pinnacle. In Europe, Rome imagined itself surrounded by barbarians; when Rome fragmented, European peoples refined a concept of an equilibrium of sovereign states and sought to export it across the world. Islam, in its early centuries, considered itself the world’s sole legitimate political unit, destined to expand indefinitely until the world was brought into harmony by religious principles. The United States was born of a conviction about the universal applicability of democracy—a conviction that has guided its policies ever since.Now international affairs take place on a global basis, and these historical concepts of world order are meeting. Every region participates in questions of high policy in every other, often instantaneously. Yet there is no consensus among the major actors about the rules and limits guiding this process, or its ultimate destination. The result is mounting tension.Grounded in Kissinger’s deep study of history and his experience as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State,World Orderguides readers through crucial episodes in recent world history. Kissinger offers a unique glimpse into the inner deliberations of the Nixon administration’s negotiations with Hanoi over the end of the Vietnam War, as well as Ronald Reagan’s tense debates with Soviet Premier Gorbachev in Reykjavík. He offers compelling insights into the future of U.S.–China relations and the evolution of the European Union, and examines lessons of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Taking readers from his analysis of nuclear negotiations with Iran through the West’s response to the Arab Spring and tensions with Russia over Ukraine,World Orderanchors Kissinger’s historical analysis in the decisive events of our time.Provocative and articulate, blending historical insight with geopolitical prognostication,World Orderis a unique work that could come only from a lifelong policymaker and diplomat.",420,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400873909l/20821140.jpg,"9,652",4.06,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

The widow of a resister murdered in the failed July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Marianne plans to uphold the promise she made to her husband’s brave conspirators: to find and protect their wives, her fellow resistance widows.First Marianne rescues six-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together, they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin’s mother, the beautiful and naive Benita, has fallen into the hands of occupying Red Army soldiers. Then she locates Ania, another resister’s wife, and her two boys, now refugees languishing in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war.As Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband’s resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But she quickly discovers that the black-and-white, highly principled world of her privileged past has become infinitely more complicated, filled with secrets and dark passions that threaten to tear them apart. Eventually, all three women must come to terms with the choices that have defined their lives before, during, and after the war—each with their own unique share of challenges.Written with the devastating emotional power ofThe Nightingale, Sarah’s Key, andThe Light Between Oceans, Jessica Shattuck’s evocative and utterly enthralling novel offers a fresh perspective on one of the most tumultuous periods in history.

She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire.

Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as ""by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion"". He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt thatThe Old Wives' Taleis a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history. This novel was serialized on British television with great success circa 2000.",565,1908,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546850884l/188454._SY475_.jpg,"4,193",3.83,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

Snart befinner sig tre män, med minimala kunskaper om arktiska förhållanden, mitt i en vit mardröm.I trettiotre år undrar en kvinna vart hennes fästman tog vägen. År 1930 hittas männen på en öde glaciärö i ishavet. Deras infrusna dagbok meddelar: nödlandning på isen efter tre dagar i luften.

The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest ""master of the art of death,"" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a ""mistress"" of the art of death. Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .",384,2007,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435958507l/86643._SY475_.jpg,"43,738",3.89,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

Jonson went on to remark that 'That Donne, for not keeping of an accent, deserved hanging', yet Donne's rhythms, once thought 'unmusical' are now recognized as the natural rhythms of the speaking voice; his 'eccentricity' as a complex self-doubt; his 'obscurity' the reflection of a brilliantly learned and allusive mind. Poets such as Eliot and Empson have found Donne's poetry profoundly attuned to our modern age, while Yeats' glowing comment will always be true: 'the intricacy and subtlety of his imagination are the length and depth of the furrow made by his passion.'This volume, superbly edited by Professor Smith, is the first complete edition to make a serious attempt to guide the reader closely through the complexities of Donne's poetry. Considerable attention has been paid to the text, and a selection of the important manuscript variants are included.

Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans.The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description—all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet.Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City—where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted—the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.In 1493, Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination",557,2011,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327900945l/9862761.jpg,"17,138",4.11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs

In it, Wendell Berry argues that good farming is a cultural development and spiritual discipline. Today’s agribusiness, however, takes farming out of its cultural context and away from families. As a result, we as a nation are more estranged from the land—from the intimate knowledge, love, and care of it.Sadly, as Berry notes in his Afterword to this third edition, his arguments and observations are more relevant than ever. We continue to suffer loss of community, the devaluation of human work, and the destruction of nature under an economic system dedicated to the mechanistic pursuit of products and profits. Although “this book has not had the happy fate of being proved wrong,” Berry writes, there are good people working “to make something comely and enduring of our life on this earth.” Wendell Berry is one of those people, writing and working, as ever, with passion, eloquence, and conviction.",246,1977,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1363657372l/146191.jpg,"4,258",4.37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816264-the-lost-dogs
