He slowly trailed his fingers over my face and backed me into the wall. My heart stopped again if that was even possible. ""You can't leave,"" he whispered. ""I need you.""

This book turns to the Sanskrit epic, Mahabharata, in order to answer the question, ‘why be good?’ and it discovers that the epic’s world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings rather than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate and discussion today after 9/11.The Mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma—in essence, doing the right thing. When a hero does something wrong in a Greek epic, he gets on with it; when a hero falters in the Mahabharata, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and contradictory take on dharma. The epic’s characters are flawed; they stumble. But their incoherent experiences throw light on our day to day emotions of envy, revenge, remorse, status anxiety, compassion, courage, duty and other moral qualities.

Thinking can be something productive and creative, but without integrating body and mind, much of our thinking is useless and unproductive. InPeace of Mind, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that integrating body and mind is the only way to be fully alive in each moment, without getting lost in our thoughts while walking, cooking, driving, and going about our everyday lives. Only by cultivating a mindful body and an embodied mind can we be fully alive. Bringing together ancient wisdom and contemporary thinking, Thich Nhat Hanh says it's like hardware and software—if you don't have both, you can't do anything.Peace of Mindprovides a foundation for beginning mindfulness practices and understanding the principles of mind/body awareness.

In the early years of the People's Republic, the Communist Party sought to transform gender relations with expansive initiatives such as assigning urban women jobs in the planned economy.

Racism,,['Albert Memmi'],9780816631650,"['Sociology', 'Race', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Politics']","Racism: It is social, not ""natural,"" it is general, not ""personal""; and it is tragically effective. In a remarkable meditation on a subject at the troubled center of American life, Albert Memmi investigates racism as social pathology -- a cultural disease that prevails because it allows one segment of society to empower itself at the expense of another. By turns historical, sociological, and autobiographical, Racism moves beyond individual prejudice and taste to engage the broader questions of collective behavior and social responsibility.The book comprises three sections -- ""Description, "" ""Definition, "" and ""Treatment"" -- in which Memmi delineates racism's causes and hidden workings, examines its close affinity to colonialism, and considers its everyday manifestations over a period of centuries throughout the West. His topics include bigotry against Blacks, anti-Semitism, the meaning of ""whiteness, "" and the status of the Quebecois.For Memmi, the structure of racism has four ""moments"": the insistenc on difference; the negative valuation imposed on those who differ; the generalizing of this negative valuation to an entire group; and the use of generalization to legitimize hostility. Memmi shows how it is not racism's content -- which can change at will -- but its form that gives it such power and tenacity.",280,1982,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347592913l/565510.jpg,81,4.32,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn
Bad Boyfriends: Using Attachment Theory to Avoid Mr. (or Ms.) Wrong and Make You a Better Partner,,['Jeb Kinnison'],0991663616,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Relationships', 'Self Help']","This book is intended to be a practical guide to using the modern science of attachment and relationships to guide the questioning toward a more fulfilling life.If you were brought up in the Western world, you’ve been trained on fairy tales of love and relationships that are misleading at best, and at worst have you making mistake after mistake in starting relationships with the wrong kinds of people who will waste your time and keep you from finding a loyal partner. Science has the answer! Or at least a guide to save you the time and effort of discovering for yourself how many wrong types of romantic partners there are.Reading this book will help you recognize the signs of some of the syndromes that prevent people from being good partners. We’ll go through those syndromes and point out some of the signs. Those little red flags you sometimes notice when you are getting to know someone? Often they speak loud and clear once you understand the types, and you can decide immediately to run away or approach with caution those who show them.If you’re young and just starting to look for a partner, good news—the world is swarming with well-adjusted, charming matches for you, if you know how to recognize them. The bad news: you are inexperienced and you may not recognize the right type of person when you date them. Many people expect to experience an immediate sense of excitement, an overwhelming rush of attraction, and to fall in love rapidly and equally with someone who feels the same. This rarely happens, and when it does it usually ends badly! And expecting it will cause you to let go of people who are steady, loving, and attentive, if you had given them a chance. So once you’ve identified someone who makes you laugh, answers your messages, and is there for you when you want them, don’t make the mistake of tossing them aside for the merely good-looking, sexy, or intriguing stranger.If you’re older, bad news: while you were spending time and effort on relationships you were hoping would turn out better, or even happily nestled in a good relationship or two, most of the secure, reliable, sane people in your age group got paired off. They’re married or happily enfamilied, and most of the people your age in the dating pool are tragically unable to form a good long-term relationship. You should always ask yourself, “why is this one still available?”—there may be a good answer (recently widowed or left a long-term relationship), or it may be that this person has just been extraordinarily unlucky in having over twenty short relationships in twenty years (to cite one case!) But it’s far more likely you have met someone with a problematic attachment style. As you age past 40, the percentage of the dating pool that is able to form a secure, stable relationship drops to less than 30%[1]; and since it can take months of dating to understand why Mr. or Ms. SeemsNice is really the future ex-partner from Hell, being able to recognize the difficult types will help you recognize them faster and move on to the next.This book outlines the basics (which might be all you need), and points you toward more resources if you want to understand more about your problem partner. If you're wondering if the guy or girl you've been hanging out with might not be quite right, this is the place to match those little red flags you've noticed with known bad types. And by getting out fast, you can avoid emotional damage and wasted time, and get going on finding someone who's really right for you. Study all of the bad types and you'll detect them before even getting involved. Or you could be one of the few people who recognizes their own problems in one of these types. There are study materials and plans of action for you, too.",202,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394823694l/21461962.jpg,191,3.84,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.The essence of all religions is to know God, to realize Him in the soul, to establish an inner attunement with that supreme unknown power, to become one with God. Each religion represents a great truth, a particular excellence something which is its soul. They all are looking at truth from different stand points, birth, education they are supplementary to one another, not contradictory.

What They Did There: Profiles from the Battle of Gettysburg,,['Steve Hedgpeth'],,"['Military History', 'Civil War', 'History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Nonfiction']","This book first drew breath as a blog begun in the winter of 2013 during the run-up to the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg in early July of that same year.The blog was to be my first sustained piece of writing since 2008, when I’d left the newspaper business after 25 years as a features writer and editor. If the venue had changed, my approach did not. During my career, I’d specialized in short profiles of celebrities, mostly from the field of television. I was never much for longer pieces of writing, preferring punchy vignettes that I’d hoped nonetheless were both informative and entertaining.I brought this stylistic template to profiling people who had been involved in the Battle of Gettysburg, my interest in which dates back to my childhood in the ‘60s. The 1960s, that is. My intent was to write 150 profiles to dovetail with the 150th anniversary. I didn’t really know if I could find that many people of interest to write about, but as it turned out I found more than I’d expected, especially considering that I had little interest in profiling those who had been profiled silly since the last shot was fired in the battle.So, no Robert E. Lee or George Meade or Winfield Scott Hancock or George Armstrong Custer and so on. As an example, take Gen. Gouveneur Warren, who has a striking monument on the field owing to his repute as “the Savior of Little Round Top.” I didn’t think yet another profile of Warren was needed, so I opted to write about one of his aides, a young engineering officer named Washington Roebling, who long after the battle smoke had cleared from his eyes became the principal engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge.What you’ll find here are roughly 175 profiles, not just of combatants blue and gray, but of civilians, doctors, nurses, artists, photographers, Samaritans; saints, sinners and the moral terrain in-between; men, women, children.",387,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397054433l/21872478.jpg,171,3.95,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""Kamby Bolongo"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""--Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.",0,1980,Tamil,,47,4.47,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Sex and the Origins of Death,,['William R. Clark'],9780195121193,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Death', 'Evolution']","Why death? Is death an inextricable consequence of life? If not, where did death come from? In Sex and the Origins of Death, William R. Clark looks at life and death at the level of individual cells to address questions such as why we age, why cells die, and why sex and death seem to go hand in hand. Why must we die? To shed light on this question, Clark reaches far back in evolutionary history, to the moment when ""inevitable death"" (death from aging) first appeared. For cells during the first billion years, death, when it occurred, was accidental; there was nothing programmed into them that said they must die. But fierce competition gradually led to multicellular animals - size being an advantage against predators - and with this change came cell specialization and, most important, germ cells in which reproductive DNA was segregated from the DNA used to operate individual cells. When sexual reproduction evolved, it became the dominant form of reproduction on the planet, in part because mixing DNA from two individuals generates altogether new germline DNA. During this process, most mutations that have crept into the germline are corrected. But this does not happen in the other (somatic) cells of the body; the mutations are not corrected, and continue to accumulate. The somatic cells become, from a genetic point of view, both superfluous and dangerous. Nature's solution to this dilemma, Clark concludes, was programmed death - the somatic cells must die. Unfortunately, we are the somatic cells. Death is necessary to exploit to the fullest the advantages of sexual reproduction.",208,1996,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347492558l/1120196.jpg,89,4.25,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Back then, education, football, and Hollywood were wrapped in capitalism and sentimentality.Embracing distraction and fighting with concentration,Momentitiousnesscaptures the spirit and literary needs of this generation and its heirs with its spurious connections and tangential relationships. Loosely lassoing the possibilities enabled by the digital evolution toward boundless search, this novel collection first establishes the “you” and then proceeds to obliterate the “I” in multiple dimensions.Nibble on this new literary form—obsessively perched between collection and novel—as it wanders along a least-squares path from moment to moment, from singularity to communion. Here, find stories—from arbitrage to zombies, Chicago to Columbia, dark to energy—about love and disappointment, science and spirits, and life, death, and the undead.

Lacking an understanding of Joseph’s condition, the family is left to deal with his upsetting transformation and subsequent homelessness. The perspectives of his three children, his spouse, and his own distorted reality combine to offer readers a glimpse of a world that will either feel hauntingly familiar or dramatically eye-opening.With so many recent tragedies involving individuals with untreated severe mental illness, families, doctors, and police are often blamed for not doing enough. The solution, however, is rarely simple. Losing Dad poignantly shows the effects of inadequate treatment for those living with a severe mental illness in America. Losing Dad not only features Joseph's harrowing -- and still ongoing -- flight from reality, but also valuable information about severe mental illness, a crippling disease that affects 1 in 17. Bonus: provides a list of resources, a discussion of current mental health laws, and exclusive family member interviews with several family members. Ideal for book clubs, reading discussion questions are included.The Foreword written by Xavier Amador,Ph.D., Founder, LEAP Institute and Author, I am Not Sick, I Don't Need Help!

At midnight along this street – with the sound of rock music pounding insistently out of club doors presided over by steroid-inflated bouncers, among men vomiting into the gutters – I saw children as young as six, unattended by adults, waiting for their parents to emerge from their nocturnal recreations.The doctor and consultant psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple looks at Great Britain - the nation which produced Newton and Darwin, Shakespeare and Dickens, David Hume and Adam Smith - and marvels at what it has become.Its inner cities and council estates are places where 'the whole gamut of human folly, wickedness, and misery may be perused at leisure... abortions procured by abdominal kung fu; children who have children; women abandoned by the father of their child a month before or a month after delivery; insensate jealousy; serial stepfatherhood that leads to sexual and physical abuse of children on a mass scale.'This timeless and beautifully-written collection of essays, looking at the collapse of the British way of life from an unashamedly conservative perspective, lays the blame squarely on the shoulders of the liberal intellectuals, who tend 'not to mean quite what they say, and express themselves more to flaunt the magnanimity of their intentions than to propagate truth.'When a well-known criminologist wrote that ""the normalisation of drug use is parallelled by the normalisation of crime"", and criminal behaviour no longer required special explanation, he surely didn’t mean that he wouldn’t mind if his own children started to shoot up heroin or rob old ladies in the street. Nor would he be indifferent to the intrusion of burglars into his own house.But, of course, it is the poor who are mugged and burgled, not the criminologists.The man’s complacency was by no means unusual. A few days earlier I had met a publisher for lunch, and the subject of the general level of culture and education in England came up. The publisher is a cultivated man, widely read and deeply attached to literature, but I had difficulty in convincing him that there were grounds for concern. That illiteracy and innumeracy were widespread did not worry him in the least, because – he claimed – they had always been just as widespread. (The fact that we now spent four times as much per head on education as we did 50 years ago and were therefore entitled to expect rising rates of literacy and numeracy at the very least did not in the slightest knock him off his perch.) He simply did not believe me when I told him that nine of ten young people between the ages of 16 and 20 whom I met in my practice could not read with facility and were incapable of multiplying six by nine, or that out of several hundreds of them I had asked when the Second World War took place, only three knew the answer. He replied smoothly – almost without the need to think, as if he had rehearsed the argument many times – that his own son, age seven, already knew the dates of the war.‘The trouble is,’ he said in all seriousness, ‘your sample is biased.’True enough: everyone’s experience is founded upon a biased sample. But it didn’t occur to him to doubt whether his sample – of one, the son of a publisher living in a neighbourhood where houses usually cost more than £800,000 – really constituted a refutation of my experience of hundreds of cases, an experience borne out by all serious research into the matter.",284,2001,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328308781l/10275303.jpg,"2,699",4.22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

The War Never Ended: Memories of Holocaust Survivors,,['Simon Hammelburg'],9402600272,"['World War II', 'Holocaust', 'History', 'War']","The War never Ended – Memories of Holocaust Survivors is a fascinating, soberly written book that reads like a novel but consists of facts, some of which have never been widely published. When living in Los Angeles, the author received phone calls from 1200 people in reaction to a campaign raised to help American Jews and other individuals file claims for property they had lost during the Nazi regime in what would later be Eastern Germany. Many of these phone calls were unrelated to the issue of filing the claims. On many occasions someone simply needed to talk to a complete stranger who lent a listening ear and understood. The conversations were usually long monologues about experiences in concentration camps like Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, even Sobibor. The victims talked about their escapes from the hands of the Nazi's, and about their harsh return after the liberation.When the process of filing claims was finished, the author found himself in the possession of a wealth of information, not only about the experiences of Holocaust survivors but also about the post-war generation. The personal, moving and candid witness statements and memories were all transcribed and verified, and provided shocking insights into the psychological aftermath of the first and second generation Holocaust victims.It was felt important to make these stories and memories accessible to a larger audience, especially to young people. The author Simon Hammelburg is a holocaust educator, lecturing in Europe, the United States and Israel. We should never forget what happened during World War II, and how this impacted generations to come. For countless people the war never ended.In this book, the memories of Holocaust survivors and their children have been intelligently woven into characters that play a role in the main storyline; the main character, himself a child from Jewish parents who both survived the Second World War, is trying to come to terms with the loss of a beloved one, Daisy, by traveling back to the place where they first met and were happy together. The book ends with the Kaddish for Daisy, attended by a circle of dear childhood friends, all of them from emotionally damaged and traumatized families. In their youth, they used to escape their homes on Sundays to meet at their Clubhouse from Ichud Habonim, a worldwide Zionist organization. The clubhouse served as a safehaven where they could be children and have fun.Although the tone of the book is generally serious, the author managed to give the book a gentle touch with his dry humor. In The War never Ended - Memories of Holocaust Survivors, Simon Hammelburg shows the trauma’s of his parents’ and of his own generation without ever becoming sentimental. They have been given a voice in an intelligent and natural way. The book is of rare literary quality with some great dialogues; once you start reading, you cannot put it down until you have read the very last page.The War Never Ended – Memories of Holocaust Survivors has been dedicated to Dr Flo Kinsler (1929-2013), a Los Angeles social worker and psychologist specialized in Holocaust trauma’s.",196,1996,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401389495l/22371561.jpg,72,4.13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

A magic that has spanned the centuries, manifested in the forces of good and evil as destinies reveal themselves. It’s a splendid tale that Beaumont has spun, his plot intricate and well-conceived, regaling readers with age old mysteries, whilst the devices of suspense and tension are maintained throughout. A delightful read with gratifyingly dark overtures, generously populated with a host of angst ridden characters and the requisite romance, yet in Beaumont’s capable hands it feels refreshingly unfamiliar. Yes, you could point to a host of bestselling books in the genre and make justifiable comparisons, but Beaumont has a particular turn of phrase which is rather distinctive and it’s this combined with the mechanics of good story telling that makes for such a compelling read.A genuinely bewitching page turner, The Chronicles Of Nightwolf marks the start of an exciting new YA series and certainly deserves to grab a few headlines.

Morgan arrived on the scene. He unleashed Takeshi Kovacs–private eye, soldier of fortune, and all-purpose antihero–into the body-swapping, hard-boiled, urban jungle of tomorrow in Altered Carbon, Broken Angels, and Woken Furies, winning the Philip K. Dick Award in the process. In Market Forces, he launched corporate gladiator Chris Faulkner into the brave new business of war-for-profit. Now, in Thirteen, Morgan radically reshapes and recharges science fiction yet again, with a new and unforgettable hero in Carl Marsalis: hybrid, hired gun, and a man without a country . . . or a planet.Marsalis is one of a new breed. Literally. Genetically engineered by the U.S. government to embody the naked aggression and primal survival skills that centuries of civilization have erased from humankind, Thirteens were intended to be the ultimate military fighting force. The project was scuttled, however, when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants, dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earth’s distant, desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip back–and into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prison–a fate worse than Mars, and much more dangerous.Luckily, his “enhanced” life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons, courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. He’s another Thirteen–one who’s already shanghaied a space shuttle, butchered its crew, and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer, he was bred to fight to the death. Still, there’s no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence, treachery, corruption, and painful confrontation with himself, anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain sane–and alive–long enough to succeed?2007 1st Ed Del Rey 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1",544,2007,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388801204l/40448.jpg,"11,278",3.9,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Bruno takes a page from “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” “Catch-22,” and Kurt Vonnegut to create something absolutely original: “The Weapon of My Delusion.” The epic novel takes its place beside some of the greatest of the “genre-less” books, leaping into a visionary take of the simple tune, “Hey Joe.” Leaving a complex plot in the background and focusing on the character study, the characters of this crime story become the plot as a violent gunman seeks redemption.The man in the trench coat, simply known as Joe, had made a life for himself as the most lethal and profitable bounty hunter in the KBH gang. Things were going well for this hunter-of-men… that is, until it was reported that he had killed his true love. What the underworld next was asking was why?“Perhaps it was best just to run now and ask questions later…. Joe would be wandering at 90 MPH into the dark, unaware that those who had been his comrades would now begin lassoing their ropes about his neck, effortlessly, relentlessly, one by one.”And so it was that his organization put a bounty on Joe’s head, and of course, the police had some questions for him, too, for his organization was only rumored to exist. And to find him, would mean some classy book deals for all involved.But Joe’s story isn’t just another shoot-‘em-up; it’s a tale that asks the question “What makes right right, and wrong wrong?” And more importantly: “If you give peace a chance, will it be so kind as to return to the favor?”At the center of this epic, outrageous chase across an America of the late twentieth century, are the three relationships that drive Joe - his “woman of the Euphrates” whose death remains mystery, his relationship with the gang kingpin, Boss Samuels, who “ran the organization like a coach driver: a master whose control is derived by blinding servants to the chaos within,” and a new woman, Nadine, who tries to convince him that the only life worth living is the one without the gun.This chase will change everything. First the motley assortment of bounty hunters, each with the merry ticks and musings over life-and-death. Do they follow the Code that has kept them strong, or follow their boss who seems to make his own rules (and to be honest, is probably insane)? On the other side is a police woman with a fire burning within, and a “scorpion” inside her brain — the gang of rappers who need to get more “gangsta” and find potential in the oncoming storm — the hippie who must decide how far he’ll go to be Peace’s bitch — and the bounty hunter himself who only wants to fade away like a ghost, but realizes that there is a weapon of delusion that is forcing him to face his past.“The Weapon of My Delusion” is a rip-roaring, dark comedy crisscrossing the country; from California to Georgia, slums to mansions, Mexico to the Afterlife. And in the end, the triumphant may simply be the one who finds out that, though the pen is mightier than the sword, delusions are stronger than them all.",0,2014,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418866902l/22565302.jpg,1,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. ""Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.",384,1941,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347320487l/93517.jpg,"2,720",4.08,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Building a Financial Fortress: Lessons from the Great Recession for Savers and Investors,,['Nick Reichert'],9781500357344,[],"This book is a re-publication of a blog I started in the depths of the Great Recession in March 2011. During that time, as I agonized over investing, saving and potential job loss, I developed an investment philosophy I dubbed the ""Financial Fortress"" and wrote a series of posts about it along with other posts about specific asset classes, investment strategies and related topics. My two biggest successes have been in real estate and precious metals. During the Great Recession, I made some aggressive moves, using retirement savings, to purchase distressed condominiums in Orange County, California. In addition to enjoying positive cash flow while I owned the properties, I have just completed one sale and have a second one in escrow, doubling my money in five years. I also made an aggressive move into silver (US Silver Eagle coins) to watch them triple in value, at which time I sold individual rolls on EBay and kept the rest for future appreciation. The essence of the Financial Fortress is that as savers and investors, we need to first have a strong defense before we can have a strong offense. As volatility in world markets seems to worsen each year and booms/busts become more intense, preservation of capital is paramount but so is finding opportunities to leverage what we have in order to grow our wealth.",184,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405301131l/22718835.jpg,11,3.55,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Rather, meditation – or mindfulness – is ultimately a state of being in which we are capable of both action and stillness, work and play, and able to be fully present to each moment of life as it comes. Osho's insights into the nature of the modern mind, with its tendency to judge and compare, provides a helpful entry point for longtime meditators as well as beginners.Mindfulness in the Modern Worldcovers a wide range of topics, including five experiential techniques that will help you bring awareness to your everyday life.The Osho Life Essentials series focuses on the most important questions in the life of the individual.

Wordsworth, his sidekick Savant Poe and a motley crew of villagers venture into the wood to see what damage has been done.To their amazed befuddlement, right in the centre of the seared earth is a giant mound of molten toffee and within it, a selection of human remains.Ænus P. Wordsworth takes it upon himself to find out who these bones belong to and how they came to be there. In doing so, he uncovers a horrific tale of murder, incest and cannibalism that spreads throughout the neighbouring villages that surround Phooka Wood.Their investigation takes them to all corners of their roundabout world; from Mortal End to the oozing Hamlet of Stifle and Little Napoo. Along their colourful journey, we are introduced to a larger than life cast from Doc Sheare the barber surgeon, Verrye Brutall the handsome woodsman, Beliala Bigswoln the publican’s daughter, Baron Rubigo Bluebeard and Umbra the Bogyman.Everyone seems to have a secret that they are trying to hide that could give clues to the horror of Phooka Wood. Even Ænus P. Wordsworth has something to hide!""Why does guilt hang heavy in this village like offal in a stew? What secret has the God-fearing Ænus P. Wordsworth kept so carefully? Where have all the children gone? These and many other questions will be answered when you read Mortal End.What readers are saying about Mortal End: A Simmering Pit of Jiggery Pokery:""It's a smidge of Dickens, shaken but not stirred with ""A League of Gentlemen"", sort of starcrossed with a bit of Neil Gaiman, plus a soupcon of Terry Pratchett. And totally and utterly your own!”“Mortal End is the funniest and most disturbing adult fairytale ever written.”""My imagination is being flooded with the most enormous canvas of human depravity… and I am finding that it fills me with delight.”""Despite it's subject matter it is light-hearted in it's delivery and the clever way the writer expresses herself is a joy to behold.""""Love the incredibly clever mind of Toula Mavridou-Messer. Excited to read her next book as well!”""Love the prose, the most colourful, creepy, characters in their deliciously rancid world.""""Toula's imagination knows no bounds. Her characters are original and fascinating and leap off the page. She is a smart writer with the ability to make a story exciting and mysterious and will take your breath away."" - LA WRITERS CENTERMortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, the debut novel from Toula Mavridou-Messer, was written in the space of three weeks after two car crashes in just one hour. Even the rescue serviceman who came to collect her from the mangled wreckage was hesitant about transporting her, saying, ""Things happen in threes, don't they?""""It's a sign,"" thought Toula, as those crashes came during the return journey from a residential crime writing course she attended, given by best-selling author Val McDermid. She had been battling a major problem faced by so many would-be authors - that of actually finishing a project and then doing something with it.Facing death head on seems to have been the antidote, although not necessarily recommended as a remedy for all. Every time Toula was faced with either a blank page or the option of walking away from the type-writer, she remembered that she had been spared a fate worse than death...or in fact, death and that small fact kept her chained to her desk.Fortunately she saw the funny side and hopefully so will you when you read Mortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, available from Amazon, Kindle and Barnes & Noble.",178,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407025016l/22854779.jpg,33,4.24,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Journey To  Healing and Wholeness,,['Paul Halbeck'],9781495291579,[],"This is written as a ""healing journey,"" not just as a book on healing, I think you will find it to be much broader in its scope than that. For I am writing this not just from academic knowledge, but as I write it, I am also going through this same journey to receive my healing.The book will guide the reader through the Word of God in a logical progression of steps, making the reader aware of the power behind the Word, for Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly, John 10:10. God's Word is able to meet all of our needs if we but let His Word work in our lives, for we are generally the one's that limit the Word from working. The Word can heal us both emotional, physically and bring us into a closer and a deeper relationship with Him.If the world that we live in was actually created by God's Word, (Jesus), John 1:3, then God's Word is the parent force of all creation. Scripture goes on to say, all things were created by Him and for Him, Colossians 1:16; thus Jesus had a purpose for creating His creation. If these two scriptures are true, then it would be to our benefit to learn about this Man Jesus Christ and His Word. If our focus remains on the Word, we will then be lead into that abundant life, that Jesus came to give us, rather than just settling for what the world can give us.The manuscript addresses many relevant topics in every day language concerning God's Word. There are many short and concise chapter topics, as shown in the table of contents:* IntroductionBeginning mind-sets:* God's Word the healing power* Knowing that God is your Father* Realizing that God is a good God* Knowing God's love for you* Knowing that God wants you well* Having a strong desire to get well* Leaving your past hurts in the past* Will you receive God forgiveness?* You are worthy of God's healing* Letting God's Word become real* Desiring a closer walk with Him* Having a thankful heart* It will be done according to your faith* A living God and His living Word* Do not disqualify My peoplePursuing every healing path possible:* Jesus took our infirmities* Imagination and hope, a primary step* What scriptures are you standing on* Speaking life instead of death* Speaking God's Word over your body* Are you willing to be carried?* Will you accept His free gift of healing* Having the elders pray over you* Asking others for a prayer of agreement* Participating in Holy Communion* Praise and worship, a powerful tool* Healed by the spirit within us* Walking in the authority as a son of God* Having the Lord rebuke the devourerBiblical healing philosophies:* It's all about what Jesus accomplished* Making the commitment to succeed* It's a spiritual battle not a physical one* Not quitting before the war is over* As a man thinks in his heart so is he* Making God's Word your life source* Living out of the spirit and not the flesh* Natural healing vs. divine healing* Healing vs. walking in wholeness* Healing and wholeness, in this lifetime* Becoming poor in spirit* When you have done all, keep standing* OK, I am standing, now what?The Journey Continues:* Be prepared to go it alone* Allowing God's kingdom to reign within* Divine healing comes by spiritual things* Closing comments* Epilogue",224,2014,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407964533l/22886742.jpg,6,4.17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Quite frankly, it is hard to say, as usually when we are denied something, more frequently than not, we are never told why.From the statistics above, we can see that social media is a huge determining factor in whether or not us, our children or our friends and family are accepted into the college of our dreams or into our dream jobs. In my professional life, I have always been told that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In other words, it is better to be fully equipped and prepared for the opportunity as it arises, as opposed to wondering what we did wrong after we are passed up. Much like how a building must have their foundation built into the cornerstone that allows it to withstand the tests of time, we must have our foundation etched and chiseled out so we can be the best that we can be. This book, The Etiquette of Social Media, is the complete guide on the basic foundation that we all need to ensure that our online image is bulletproof from being judged by the decision makers of the world who may be able to have control of our destiny.Social Media is paving the way of the future.

Whether you are in high school or a senior level executive, chances are you are oblivious to the guidelines of how to act on social media. In this day and age, that has been forgivable.Why?Because never before has there been a guide covering The Etiquette of Social Media, until now.Inspired by best-selling author James Altucher, Leonard Kim decided to write his first book of many.

And they don't have much room to point fingers anyway. They're embroiled in a money laundering and people smuggling business, which is currently under attack. Magda, as recalcitrant as a mule, sets out to unmask the threat and serve her own brand of justice. She wants to protect her family, but what she needs is to make amends with her wrongdoings, face her past traumas, and finally find a place in the world where she can fit in. High stakes, cold blood, and dark humor spiral around this fierce, female assassin, whose journey takes her through Baja California, Barcelona, and suburban Los Angeles in a snarky combination of crime noir and chick lit. Magda's story is an action-packed and emotional exploration of taking responsibility for your choices and paying for those of your parents.",205,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409248349l/22913381.jpg,18,3.94,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Christian Counselor and Mensa member Ron Leonard tackles the all-important and pervasive issue of discerning when your culture (and occasionally your friends and family), are trying to lie, take advantage of, and bamboozle you. After all, if Satan is the ""Father of Lies"" did you think he was going to stop at the church doors? Sometimes we're fooled by our own selfish desires. Sometimes we're fooled because we are ""believers."" Since church members are rarely trained in earthly discernment, we tend to believe foolish things to the detriment of our lives and to the dismay of would-be believers. Topics covered include What is Truth, as well as Truth in Science, Politics, Advertising, and the Church. Principles for discerning truth are addressed as well as practical case studies on applying those principles.

The Pacific Depths,,['Gary Paul Stephenson'],9781493137992,[],"KIRKUS REVIEWA billionaire’s attempts to make profound changes to counter global problems such as climate change are met with severe resistance from the U.S. president in Stephenson’s debut thriller.New Zealander Charles Langham, at a United Nations meeting, implores the U.N. to take more active roles in combating famine and the deforestation of rain forests and promoting alternative fuels. This plea includes a vague warning, giving the U.N. a week to comply or Charles will take action. It seems that U.S. President Mike Read, who views Charles as a threat to the American economy, may be the billionaire’s biggest adversary. President Read sends a U.S. ship after Charles’ superyacht, Sundancer, presumably to attack, and Charles responds by disabling the vessel with an electromagnetic pulse fired from one of his subs. Charles then makes a statement to the public that he plans to use a device to create two tsunamis (designed to inflict only “minor damage”)to hit the U.S., but Read soon sends a covert team to eliminate Charles. The novel embraces its climate change message by directly addressing the issue, and its suggested solution—Charles sends specialists to countries to help the people become self-reliant—is both practical and feasible within the novel’s context. America initially is the villain, but as the story progresses, it’s clear that the true antagonist is President Read, who gradually loses the support of other nations and even his own advisers. The bulk of the novel is essentially a showdown between Read and Charles, who seemingly has enough money and employees to be a viable opponent for a man who leads a country. There’s very little suspense, however, as Charles is never in any real danger; he’s protected by boats, submarines, “extremely well paid” security teams and a deep-sea HQ. He supplements his story by moving beyond the U.S. situation, including Charles’ team making a strike against a drug cartel in Brazil, and spotlighting strong characters—although the book is nearly stolen by Abbey, Charles’ border collie, who has more personality than his children, Cathy and Chris.Charles isn’t terribly charismatic, but his integrity and seemingly endless resources make for a great read.",226,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410494815l/23203724.jpg,16,4.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television,,['Jerry Mander'],9780688082741,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Cultural', 'Education', 'Psychology', 'Politics', 'Media Tie In', 'Tv']","A total departure from previous writing about television, this book is the first ever to advocate that the medium is not reformable. Its problems are inherent in the technology itself and are so dangerous -- to personal health and sanity, to the environment, and to democratic processes -- that TV ought to be eliminated forever.Weaving personal experiences through meticulous research, the author ranges widely over aspects of television that have rarely been examined and never before joined together, allowing an entirely new, frightening image to emerge. The idea that all technologies are ""neutral,"" benign instruments that can be used well or badly, is thrown open to profound doubt. Speaking of TV reform is, in the words of the author, ""as absurd as speaking of the reform of a technology such as guns.""",384,1977,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386921445l/228250.jpg,"1,353",4.12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Sid's Place: Tom Calder's life underground in the psychedelic sixties of California,,['The Hippy Coyote'],9781575513,[],"Our hero, Tom Calder, is a drug dealer. He is involved in a car crash while transporting 100 kilos of marijuana in San Diego, California. He runs from the law, joins a terrorist cell of the People's Freedom Army, PFA, in San Francisco, and with a vengeful heart murders a rapist in prison.Three years of turbulence described in detail by Richard Del Connor who lived amongst the fugitives, exiles, draft dodgers, criminals, and Green Berets of the flower power years. Sid's Place is a rare inside look at the underground lifestyles of the Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan years.""The information in SID'S PLACE is based upon my personal experiences. Ernest Hemingway inspired me with his concept of transforming his life into fictional stories. That’s what I’ve done here. It’s possible I have revealed sensitive or classified government secret service information, but it is so old and outdated I couldn’t remember who told me what or who did what... even if they pumped me full of truth serum.""""Yes, I was a drug dealer from 1968 to 1970, but I was only 14 to 16 years old. Many of these experiences were my friends or their older brothers. Having not read this book for many years prior to this rewrite it was a fun flashback for me as I relived this book, or in many cases remembered the girls who inspired the love scenes.""""Restrain your contempt for me if you’re anti-drugs, anti-sex, anti-anti-war... and for all the splinter groups I may have offended--please don't get pissed... Whew! My goal is to be loved and liked. I hope to make friends with this book, not enemies. If you hate this book, too bad, bug off and leave me alone. I’ve already had plenty of hate mail, threats on my answer machine... so don’t waste your time.""""One of my motives for writing this book was to explore how things might have gone for me under different circumstances. Like Tom, I got busted in my van, but I hung around and got a lucky break when my Uncle offered to take me in, in Newfoundland. My accomplice friend went to jail, I went to Newfoundland. Another motive for writing this book was to explore the possible error of my pacifistic passivity. I take a quiet pride in the fact I have not killed anyone in this current lifetime, and despite opportunities and good reasons, still decided not to when other people were encouraging me. In this story I pushed myself to the limit where I would take a life, purposefully. Better my imagination than reality. As for the drug tripping, I explored that plenty in reality, or different realities. I’ve got a lot more of those stories to tell. So enjoy a glimpse of my teenage world. Sadly, as civilization seems to be heading toward less love and more war, by reading my book Sid's Place, you can see a generation that fought this Uncle Warbucks trend.""",0,2012,,,1,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

George Bernard Shaw declared that he was the most beautiful human being he had ever seen and Aldous Huxley was one of his close friends. Whether debating politics with Nehru, discussing theories with Rupert Sheldrake and Iris Murdoch, or challenging his students not to take his words at face value, Krishnamurti engaged fully with every aspect of life. He is regarded by many modern religious figures as a great teacher, an extraordinary individual with revolutionary insights; Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra are all indebted to his writings.Freedom from the Knownis one of Krishnamurti's most accessible works.

Those who have not had such a loss of someone very close, seldom realize the depth and breadth of that pain. As a result, in an effort to make the bereaved (or themselves) feel better, and to distance themselves from the event they say and do some outrageous and unthinking things. Others, possessing very tender hearts, say and do some of the kindest things imagineable.

We prepare for school by attending Pre-K. We prepare to get our Driver's License by taking driving lessons. We got to pre-marital counseling before we wed.

Most of us fail in the third part, as we hopelessly try to change things that either are not amenable to change or unworthy of our time and energy.Dealing effectively with either major life events or daily stressors requires the ability to maintain composure, take a time-out and ‘talk sense’ to oneself. Useful questions to ponder when under pressure include:-Is there something I can do right now to solve this problem?-Is it worth my time and energy?-Is my behaviour helping me deal with this and accomplish my ultimate goals?-What can happen to me, if I continue acting in a state of frenzy or remain depressed?-How long can my body endure in this state, without sustaining any undesirable health consequences?-How can I use this event?-What have I learned from it?-What good do I see in all of it?The book aims to inspire, as well as to educate. In the first part the author discusses stress, its sources and its effects, followed by the ‘Ro’ Method, a simple but complete problem solving process, and a number of examples and real life applications. Then, using a light, humorous and innovative style, the author describes the day of ‘Don Stressote,’ a modern Don Quichote de la Mancha and ‘Ro’ Method graduate, who attempts to apply the theory in everyday life situations.

Pantheisticon explores Pantheist beliefs and presents a liturgical model for Pantheist community. This edition includes both a modern English translation and transcript of the 1751 text, plus an introduction by Dr Jason Cooper as well as an explanatory essay titled 'The Eternal Universe as God: Rediscovering Pantheisticon'. The essay establishes Toland as a key thinker of the Early Enlightenment and also a figure well ahead of his time.

It is based on the Toyota (lean) model, which combines operational excellence with value-based strategies to produce steady growth through a wide range of economic conditions.In contrast with the crash-and-burn performance of companies trumpeted by business gurus in the 1990s, the firms profiled inLean Thinking-- from tiny Lantech to midsized Wiremold to niche producer Porsche to gigantic Pratt & Whitney -- have kept on keeping on, largely unnoticed, along a steady upward path through the market turbulence and crushed dreams of the early twenty-first century. Meanwhile, the leader in lean thinking -- Toyota -- has set its sights on leadership of the global motor vehicle industry in this decade.Instead of constantly reinventing business models, lean thinkers go back to basics by asking what the customer really perceives asvalue.(It's often not at all what existing organizations and assets would suggest.) The next step is to line up value-creating activities for a specific product along avalue streamwhile eliminating activities (usually the majority) that don't add value. Then the lean thinker creates aflowcondition in which the design and the product advance smoothly and rapidly at thepullof the customer (rather than the push of the producer). Finally, as flow and pull are implemented, the lean thinker speeds up the cycle of improvement in pursuit ofperfection.The first part of this book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples.Lean Thinkingclearly demonstrates that these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry in any country. But most managers need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm. Part II provides a step-by-step action plan, based on in-depth studies of more than fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world.Even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in Part III that another dramatic leap is possible by creating an extended lean enterprise for each of their product families that tightly links value-creating activities from raw materials to customer.In Part IV, an epilogue to the original edition, the story of lean thinking is brought up-to-date with an enhanced action plan based on the experiences of a range of lean firms since the original publication ofLean Thinking.Lean Thinkingdoes not provide a new management ""program"" for the one-minute manager. Instead, it offers a new method of thinking, of being, and, above all, of doing for the serious long-term manager -- a method that is changing the world.",400,1996,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348994676l/289467.jpg,"5,763",3.87,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

But for writer T.K. Thorne, just one reference was enough to ignite her imagination and form the basis for her dazzling new novel, ANGELS AT THE GATE (Cappuccino Books, March 2015). Like Noah’s Wife, Thorne’s highly praised debut, this book brings the ancient world to life through the eyes of an extraordinary woman.Based on historical, biblical, and archaeological research, visits to the Middle East, and a large measure of creativity, ANGELS AT THE GATE is the story of Adira, destined to become Lot’s wife. A daughter of Abram's tribe, Adira is an impetuous young girl whose mother died in childbirth. Secretly raised as a boy in her father’s caravan and schooled in languages and the art of negotiation, Adira rejects the looming changes of womanhood that threaten her nomadic life and independence.But with the arrival of two mysterious strangers – Northmen rumored to be holy or possibly even “Angels” – Adira’s world unravels. Raiders invade the caravan, and she loses everything she values most – her father, her freedom, and even the “Angels.”Caught between her oath to her father to return to her tribe and the “proper life for a woman” and tormented by an impossible love, she abandons all she has known in a dangerous quest to seek revenge and find her kidnapped “Angel.” With only her beloved dog, Nami, at her side, Adira must use the skills she learned in the caravan to survive the perils of the desert, Sodom, and her own heart.ANGELS AT THE GATE is a story of adventure and the power of love, exploring themes about choice – the importance of asking the right questions and walking the fine edge between duty and personal freedom.Based on a simple mention in the Bible, T.K. Thorne has developed a complex and full-bodied character in the wife of Lot, a woman both ancient and modern, who will touch readers’ hearts, and live in their memories for years to come. As Dianne Mooney, founder of Southern Living At Home says, “For all those whose curiosity is piqued by how it might have been in the time of Sodom and Gomorrah, this is a must read!”“A masterpiece of historical research, interweaving history and theology in a re-visioningof an ancient story from a woman’s perspective. Thorne is a dazzlingly gifted writer.”–Sue Walker, Poet Laureate of Alabama, 2003-2012“Thorne unspools an ancient adventure with crackling undertonesof our contemporary lives.

Tyler Johnson, THE HOLLYWOOD GOSSIPThis compelling and true life story screams of betrayal, deceit, and an unsolved mystery. It began when a budding young woman was lured into a cunning and deceptive scheme which eventually became her undoing. The tale may have gone unnoticed under normal circumstances. However, the plot thickened when a famous celebrity, Bill Cosby, was the target of a greedy rouse. The timing couldn’t have been worse as it fell on the heels of his son's murder. Ennis Cosby had been shot and killed the day an alleged extortion letter was delivered to the comedian demanding millions in hush money. During one of the most infamous trials of 1997 Cosby would face his adversary Autumn Jackson, and rue the day that she was born. Jackson could do nothing more than look into her father's eyes and weep for all that had never been. At least she believed the entertainer to be her father. This complicated and twisted saga is fraught with criminal and passion driven psychology. Who were the guilty ones and who were the innocents? “I’m Autumn Jackson’s aunt. I was called on to be her traveling companion, confidant, and unlikely bodyguard. When people asked me what happened, the answer was complicated.

In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha – a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived.This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills.The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: ‘When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge.’Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil?This is the first book in a trilogy on Shiva, the simple man whose karma re-cast him as our Mahadev, the God of Gods.The Secret of the Nagas :Today, He is a God.4000 years ago, He was just a man.The hunt is on. The sinister Naga warrior has killed his friend Brahaspati and now stalks his wife Sati. Shiva, the Tibetan immigrant who is the prophesied destroyer of evil, will not rest till he finds his demonic adversary. His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain. The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs – Shiva’s philosopher guides – betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems.Fierce battles will be fought. Surprising alliances will be forged. Unbelievable secrets will be revealed in this second book of the Shiva Trilogy, the sequel to the #1 national bestseller, The Immortals of Meluha.The Oath of the Vayuputras - Shiva Trilogy 3 :The Oath of Vayuputras is the eagerly awaited third and final part of the Shiva Trilogy by Amish. Shiva, as portrayed in the previous books of the series, is a mortal Tibetan Tribal Chief who becomes the savior of the people of Meluha and joins hands with the Nagas. In this part, Shiva realizes that Nagas are not his enemies and determines to unveil the root of all evil and his true enemy.In this final part of the Shiva Trilogy, Shiva reaches to Panchvati, the capital of the Nagas and comes face to face with Evil, a name which instills fear in the hearts of the fiercest of warriors. Shiva who is also known as Neelkanth by now, prepares for a holy war against his true enemy. Come what may, Shiva must not fail now. A series of brutal battles begins and it convulses India. In desperation to win over Evil, Shiva reaches out to the Vayuputras, who have never offered any help to him previously. He meets the chiefs of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha.Shiva also comes to know the reality about many characters that he thinks are close to him and many new characters have been introduced too in this part by the writer. Many people die in the battles but will Shiva succeed in overthrowing Evil? If so, at what cost to himself and to India? Will he finally emerge as a God from a normal mortal existence?

If he is victorious, all creation, including the Throne of Heaven will be cast into the Lake of Fire for eternity. Even the integrity of God hangs in the balance if the Messiah is destroyed before His time.Heaven's angels have been sent into the world as well, to prepare for the Great War against Helel.

Persephone in Hell,,['C.F. Joyce'],0990427714,[],"Troubled teenage Glory imagines herself a mighty queen, but discovers in her 1968 Massachusetts town that even queens have to watch their heads as savages await. Glory and her family move from Boston city life to rural cow country where people have heard of Jews but never seen a real one. A coming of age tale of a girl who doesn't understand why her sister won't talk to her and even Mother Nature seems out to get her. She cries out to the gods for help. But nobody sees her terrible self inflicted wounds. No one is paying attention. In this coming of age debut novel, C.F. Joyce explores the roles that family histories, clashing cultures, and dysfunctions play in the life of a young girl.Under the unpublished title ""Memories of Glory"", the novel won a HarperCollins Top 5 Gold Medal award. Here are some of the reviewer's comments:""It is very difficult to approach a ‘coming of age’ story, and write in such a way as to not appear clichéd, but [the author] has made a remarkably strong case. In ‘Memories of Glory’, the journey from childhood to adulthood is dealt with in a unique way; the six children in Glory’s family are used to explore various different facets of growing up. The reader is also able to understand more about the pasts of Glory’s parents and their families, allowing adult tensions to be explored too. A compelling feminist take on life dominates, but the feelings of the important men in Glory’s life are not left uncovered. The memories she recalls do not depict a clear straightforward story, rather each is a part of a puzzle which in the end paints an often brutal but fair conclusion on life...Glory is set up well as a whimsical day-dreamer. She lives in an alter-world, and her intelligence and desire to be elsewhere helps build a strong picture of her imagination. Gradually it becomes clear that the world she fashions for herself is an escape from the harsh life that she has had to lead. As a protagonist she is wonderful; her suffering is a result of both her surroundings and of universal teenage trauma: I found her hugely accessible...The use of dialogue, and the focus on different characters in each recollection, allows the reader to build a strong concept of each family member, and their relationships with one another. This is a vibrant read, and no connection is left unexplored. Friendship, as well as sibling rivalry, is beautifully drawn out...The author clearly has a gift for wit and charm, illustrated in the passage where the family go blueberry picking...The role of “Mother Nature”, of fate and fortune, is an interesting theme and one that gives an interesting dimension to the family’s attitude.""",224,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421512578l/24547109.jpg,3,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

This outing is going to be Epic! Henry is a man on the run. The beast chasing him wears the face of his murdered wife. Fueled by guilt, the beast has him running the gauntlet of an ever-hopeful, but chronically unsuccessful suicide marathon. He's spent the last four years running away from his life. During the workweek, he merely exists, performing the inevitable and necessary functions of life, moving through his world like an automaton. But when that assembly line of existence ultimately reaches its end on Friday afternoon, Henry launches into orbit on a liquor propelled rocket. His flight begins when he straps himself into his favorite barstool late Friday and ends with his splashdown sometime late Sunday night, and the time spent in between is a fog of chaotic memories. During this latest flight, however, he experiences some unexpected turbulence. This time he crash-lands seven hundred miles from home, unencumbered by a car or wallet.

Yet if you do, you will significantly increase your chances of survival.We live in a society where it seems so easy to get what you need that we take for granted how tough it would play out with a huge disaster. No more buying what you need online or walking into a grocery store for food. No more electricity when you flip a switch or running water when you turn on the faucet.While we can’t control the events that may one day unfold, we can control how we are prepared for them. With some basic items stored, you can have an upper hand on many other people that failed to get anything in place. Creating some types of allies that you would be able to depend on if you had a need during such time could make the difference between life and death.",87,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420678596l/23641381.jpg,4,4.5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Hassle Free Bedtime: Getting any child to bed is as easy as 1-2-3!,,['MaryKay Keller'],9781500919146,[],"In this book I present a three step process that will set you up for a quiet night with any child. These three chapters explain how a child responds emotionally and physically to their environment and most importantly to you. The simple solutions presented in this three step process support you and your child in setting you both up for a long and quiet sleep. I also include a Bedtime Routine Journal in which you record your new routine activities for the first six weeks. In the journal there are questions for you to answer to provide introspection on how you are doing and how your child is responding. This gives you more control over making these changes. Any change brings on resistance. What has been working for your baby/child and hasn't been working for you and now that you are determined to make the changes necessary to bring on a good nights sleep, you need reinforcement. The change in routine may make things worse for a few weeks. However, as you record and get through the resistance, you will discover that when it seems to hit the worst peak that the resistant behavior suddenly disappears and the routine has been established. Children crave consistency even when they don't know what it is or how to get there. We change when we are in enough pain to make us reach for a new behavior, this is the change! As a bonus there are three appendices that provide additional supports for overall hassle free parenting. These suggestions support and enhance the two way communication between the parent or caregiver and the child. We have often heard it said that, ""Children do not come with instructions!"" This is not true. Children come with built in instructions. What is missing is our belief that children are not born communicating with us, simply because they do not meet our communication needs for verbal expression. Because they don't use our words we mistakenly believe they are not born communicating. Raising children does not have to be frustrating or emotionally overwhelming when we know how to hear them and how to support them as they communicate life is easier and happier for the whole family!",120,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412695399l/23305079.jpg,2,4.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Only after he dares to open a forbidden door does he learn the hideous nature of their experiments -- and his own chilling role in them. Set against the disquiet of Revolutionary Boston, M. T. Anderson's extraordinary novel takes place at a time when American Patriots rioted and battled to win liberty while African slaves were entreated to risk their lives for a freedom they would never claim. The first of two parts, this deeply provocative novel reimagines the past as an eerie place that has startling resonance for readers today.",351,2006,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327870278l/169762.jpg,"15,636",3.52,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Brennan’s husband is posted to a small village in Italy, Montecchia di Crosara, and the abrupt move is a challenge to the family. Brennan must find herself while learning to live with her family in such foreign but ultimately healing surroundings. After her daughter’s death, Janet lost faith in everything. Apart from a few healing practices of going up and down a hill where Brennan observes an old woman talking to her deceased husband at his gravesite and listening to a local band’s practice music coming from a shed, all that remained was Nature with its dark woods and simple invitation. We witness Janet in the depth of heartsickness slowly but surely being able to kick up her feet “in a mock Tarantella,” thus starting a freeing ritual in nature that would not fail her. Her dancing in the woods becomes a “priestlike task of pure ablution” in the world of nature, and this helps her to get rid of her pain She now experiences Nature’s healing power like Wordsworth in his Tintern Abbey.AUTHOR BIOJanet K.

The Death View Revolution: A Guide to Transpersonal Experiences Surrounding Death,,['Madelaine Lawrence'],9781910121375,[],"Reports and studies of near-death experiences, death-bed communications, after-death communications and a host of other transpersonal experiences occurring near death are creating a new paradigm challenging our exclusive biological and psychological understanding of death and near-death. Care provided to those near death or dying is an evolving process.Before Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’s book, On Death & Dying, was published in 1969, rarely were dying patients or patients with cancer told of their diagnosis. Kubler-Ross’s descriptions of patient experiences created a paradigm shift in the care of dying patients and their loved ones that included a better understanding of their psychological needs. A decade later the Uniform Brain Death Act was passed to establish criteria for determining biological death needed because of advances in life support technology.We know now occurrences near death or dying involve more than biology and psychology. There is a transpersonal component needing to be fully integrated into the care of individuals and their family members. In this book, Madelaine Lawrence, PhD, describes the known transpersonal experiences associated with near death and dying and how, in some cases, they challenge our current understanding of psychological needs and biological death. The presentation of known transpersonal experiences in one source provides a needed holistic view.Lawrence calls for an integration of these transpersonal experiences into mainstream science and education of the public, family members and health care providers in order to provide comprehensive care of those near death and dying.",258,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422118231l/24675245.jpg,12,4.58,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

Return to Circa '96,,['Bob Sawatzki'],9781884097065,[],"The book's title, Return to Circa '96', caught my attention right off. Themes of memory, time travel, and so forth were evoked. Then the visual appeal was quite marked (my professional and personal interests tilt in favor of scripto-visual works). The ""data-base aesthetics"" (Lev Manovich) aspect of the work gave it a very contemporary Web 2.0 kind of technological relevance, which meshed well with the book's meta-fictional construction. These conceptual art-ish and surfictional elements lured me into the book. The library-as-a-framing-device, situating events within a repository of texts, hit a responsive chord given my own autodidactic / academic propensities. I felt at home in the text. The producer's mixtures of modalities of writing, a ""mulligan stew"" of different textualities, were attributes of the kinds of works I read and re-read most often. Finally, the book was funny. It not only gave that ""writerly"" jouissance touted by literary theorist Roland Barthes, but also the plaisir of a ""readerly"" text. In short, in opening Mr. Sawatzki's book, it was as if I'd found a long-lost friend. -- James R.

50 Shades of Yay: Great Thinkers on Happiness,,['Grigory Lukin'],,[],"Happiness - what exactly is it and where I can get some? These two simple questions have remained unanswered despite all our efforts. Poets bicker about the definition of happiness, scientists try to determine how happiness works, and politicians promise all the happiness you can handle if you vote for them. The Declaration of Independence calls the pursuit of happiness one of the three unalienable rights, but how exactly do you go about pursuing it?This book collects 50 essays, poems, philosophical discourses, aphorisms and snarky comments from great thinkers of our past. They include famous names (Mark Twain, Socrates, Emily Dickinson, Abraham Lincoln, Helen Keller and others), as well as some that you've probably never heard of. (Christina, Queen of Sweden, just might have been the wittiest 17th-century monarch.)The 50 perspectives on happiness collected in this volume range from goofy to serious, from optimistic to morbid. No matter what your philosophical disposition, this book is guaranteed to help you with your own, personal pursuit of happiness. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you think, it might even make you cry.

No longer can we pretend there is one right way to be in this world. Spiritual, religious and cultural beliefs may influence our choices — yet, each of us has the innate power to shape our life and form relationships through intention and volition.With life's megapixel array of distractions and diversions, we might question our energetic bandwidth to act with intention. That is, until we assess the cost of inattention — chaos, burnout, loneliness, despair.In The Otherness Factor we slip out of our contained self to observe the remarkable whole of who we are. Guided by ancient and contemporary philosophers, we discover a new alchemy of science, psychology and spirituality. Beyond theory, our capacity to co-create our life has become scientific fact — revolutionizing and reframing all we thought we knew about freewill.This book will take you to places far beyond the ordinary and offer you the power, courage and audacity to stand in your own otherness and form meaningful, lasting relationships.

"Aspertools: The Practical Guide for Understanding and Embracing Asperger's, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and Neurodiversity",,['Harold Reitman'],9780757318535,"['Neurodiversity', 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Self Help', 'Disability']","If you ask Dr. Harold Reitman, labels are a lousy way to describe a unique human being, whether it's Asperger's, high functioning autism, ADHD, dyslexia, Tourette's or even the so-called neurotypical brain itself. One size does not fit all. Everyone's brain is different.Helping others 'get it' when it comes to dealing with those with so-called learning disabilities is why Reitman has written this book. It's also why he wrote and produced The Square Root of 2, a movie about a college student who encounters—and fights—her school's unjust system. The film was inspired by the real events faced by his daughter and contributing author, Rebecca, when she went to college; her seizure disorder and—at the time—undiagnosed Asperger syndrome posed unique challenges not faced by most students.After reviewing the scientific community's research, conducted over the last nearly 40 years, Dr. Reitman believes that it's time to not just accept neurodiversity, but to embrace it, and this book will help people do just that. It is the first book to offer simple tools, action plans and resources to help understand and deal with anyone whose brain is a bit different. The astonishing rate of autism births alone (1 in 68) means that society will have to adapt to neurodiversity, just as it has had to adapt to other cultural and racial differences. Our educational system, our workplaces, and society at large will no longer be one size fits all—each individual will have the opportunity to maximize their potential—and we will be the better for it.Dr. Harold ""Hackie"" Reitman is an orthopedic surgeon, a former professional and Golden Gloves champion heavyweight boxer, philanthropist, and a movie producer. His recent release, The Square Root of 2, is a fictionalized adaptation of his daughter Rebecca's challenges at college (TheSquareRootOf2.com).",240,2015,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411334835l/23217276.jpg,115,3.57,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn

"Dear Lover,",,['Lori Jenessa Nelson'],9781311448422,"['Poetry', 'Romance']","Dear Lover –poems of love, loss, and disappointment, shame, pride, and indifference.Dear Lover—a poetry collection about hope and heartbreak, about love in its short, long, and temporary forms, about how love can be cloaked in abuse, how love can build us or break us, the hard and soft of it, the good, the bad, and the completely atrocious.The collection is a poetic story of different relationships which are organized into the stages of a relationship; that initial attraction, the circling dance around each other, the honey-moon stage, the souring, the fighting, the breaking up, and the recovering. This work is deeply personal, but relatable all the same.Autobiographical at its core, it aims for love's failures and triumphs, its disappointments and celebrations, the bad, the good, and the downright ugly. It is a poetry collection that reaches for the hearts of anyone who has ever fallen in love, thought of falling in love, fallen out of love, or is in love with the idea of love.Written in letter format, the collection includes a few sonnets, a couple villanelles, and a pantoum among the formal verse poetry, but mostly it is an experimentation with prose poetry and free verse that hardly seems free at times due to the skill with which the poet wields words.Dear Lover, includes Lori Jenessa Nelson's sharp eye for detail and idea organization, as well as her ability to express these ideas using the most evocative language, and effective, if not always proper, grammar. She wields the vocabularies that she has gleaned from her artistic background in a way that adds a delicious realism to even the saddest of poems.Because love does not always come with lovers, Dear Lover, also includes a section about casual sex, because Nelson frowns severely on slut-shaming and believes in the power of sexual freedom associated with ""having sex the way that men do.""

InThe Smoke at Dawn, the last great push of the Army of the Cumberland sets the stage for a decisive confrontation at Chattanooga that could determine the outcome of the war.Summer, 1863. The Federal triumph at Vicksburg has secured complete control of the Mississippi River from the Confederacy, cementing the reputation of Ulysses S. Grant. Farther east, the Federal army under the command of William Rosecrans captures the crucial rail hub at Chattanooga. But Rosecrans is careless, and while pursuing the Confederates, the Federal forces are routed in north Georgia at Chickamauga Creek. Retreating in a panic back to Chattanooga, Rosecrans is pursued by the Confederate forces under General Braxton Bragg. Penned up, with their supply lines severed, the Federal army seems doomed to the same kind of defeat that plagued the Confederates at Vicksburg. But a disgusted Abraham Lincoln has seen enough of General Rosecrans. Ulysses Grant is elevated to command of the entire theater of the war, and immediately replaces Rosecrans with General George Thomas. Grant gathers an enormous force, including armies commanded by Joseph Hooker and Grant’s friend, William T. Sherman. Grant’s mission is clear: Break the Confederate siege and destroy Bragg’s army.  Meanwhile, Bragg wages war as much with his own subordinates as he does with the Federals, creating dissension and disharmony in the Southern ranks, erasing the Confederate army’s superiority at exactly the wrong time.Blending evocative historical detail with searing depictions of battle, Jeff Shaara immerses readers in the world of commanders and common soldiers, civilians and statesmen. From the Union side come the voices of Generals Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and George Thomas—the vaunted “Rock of Chickamauga”—as well as the young private Fritz “Dutchie” Bauer. From the Rebel ranks come Generals Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, and James Longstreet, as well as the legendary cavalry commander, Nathan Bedford Forrest. A tale of history played out on a human scale in the grand Shaara tradition,The Smoke at Dawnvividly recreates the climactic months of the war in the West, when the fate of a divided nation truly hangs in the balance.",495,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395611383l/18373208.jpg,"2,365",4.26,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373208-the-smoke-at-dawn
