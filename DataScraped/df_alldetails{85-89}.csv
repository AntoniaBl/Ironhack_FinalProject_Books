The Squirrel that Dreamt of Madness,,['Craig  Stone'],1785890662,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Humor']","Alternate Cover Image: ASIN: B005JU92GOAWARDSCraig Stone's second novel Life Knocks was shortlisted for the world respected Dundee International Book Prize, and he has appeared live on the BBC.BOOK DESCRIPTION""The British author, Craig Stone, is as interesting a person as the characters he creates. Miserable at his day job, he decided to take a leap of faith. His path to success was all or nothing, victory or death.He quit his job and dropped out of the white-collar world with all its trappings and amenities. Unemployed, he had to give up his residence. With a sleeping bag and a sackful of clothes he headed to Northwest London's Gladstone Park, settling in among the homeless, transients, dog walkers and the occasional irritated park worker. His only solace, an A4 notepad and a pen.Like the author, the main character Colossus Sosloss also quits his job, becomes homeless and sleeps in the park. Colossus observes the other homeless who reside at the park. Many of them with treatable or controllable mental illness but, in the post-Margaret Thatcher England, such individuals are human refuse. Dumped into society to fend for themselves and spiral downward amongst the neatly-trimmed hedges and glistening, manicured lawn of the sprawling public space.The character's travails are reminiscent of a Lewis Carroll-type adventure with subtle Dickensian undertones. Which include a lost parrot and an unfortunate man named Squirrel. We follow Colossus on his journey to the edge of sanity, with humorous interjections and clever idioms. A hero's quest, that inevitably ends with subterfuge, realization and reflection.Today, no longer homeless, Craig Stone is probably one of the most promising young writers to grace the indie and self-publishing world. Though at 31, Stone is a surprisingly mature author who seems to transcend the generations. His literary work is suitable for the very young and for those who have lived an interesting lifeThe Squirrel That Dreamt Of Madness is an imaginative tale that can only come from a brilliant, albeit delightfully demented, mind. Stone mixes humour with the cold, stark reality of life. Everything and everyone, is a metaphor for something either sinister or truthful. Gifted students may soon find this book on their required reading list for their advanced High School contemporary literature class.The author does not have a long laundry list of writers who inspired him, though he definitely channels some Steinbeckian qualities (the novel was written during the height of the Great Recession) and J.D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye.Like Hemingway who retreated to the wild and lawless pre-Castro Cuba to pen his magnum opus The Old Man and the Sea, Stone chose to immerse himself in a colder and wetter climate to experience what his character had to endure. The old adage, you write what you know, still rings resonantly true. Stone certainly writes what he knows, and writes it exceptionally well.""-enovelreviewsREVIEWS""Genius.

Narrator Prescott Fielding, a 12-year-old boy from the 18th century, is washed ashore onto a volcanic island, where he befriends Caleb Thompson, a seventeen-year-old Vietnam War era U. S. Marine. How can two people born 200 years apart exist together at one time? Are they living in a time warp? Outside of time?

The Orchardist,,['Amanda Coplin'],9780062188502,"['Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Westerns', 'Novels', 'Adult']","Set in the untamed American West, a highly original and haunting debut novel about a makeshift family whose dramatic lives are shaped by violence, love, and an indelible connection to the land.You belong to the earth, and the earth is hard.At the turn of the twentieth century, in a rural stretch of the Pacific Northwest in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, a solitary orchardist named Talmadge carefully tends the grove of fruit trees he has cultivated for nearly half a century. A gentle, solitary man, he finds solace and purpose in the sweetness of the apples, apricots, and plums he grows, and in the quiet, beating heart of the land--the valley of yellow grass bordering a deep canyon that has been his home since he was nine years old. Everything he is and has known is tied to this patch of earth. It is where his widowed mother is buried, taken by illness when he was just thirteen, and where his only companion, his beloved teenaged sister Elsbeth, mysteriously disappeared. It is where the horse wranglers--native men, mostly Nez Perce--pass through each spring with their wild herds, setting up camp in the flowering meadows between the trees.One day, while in town to sell his fruit at the market, two girls, barefoot and dirty, steal some apples. Later, they appear on his homestead, cautious yet curious about the man who gave them no chase. Feral, scared, and very pregnant, Jane and her sister Della take up on Talmadage's land and indulge in his deep reservoir of compassion. Yet just as the girls begin to trust him, brutal men with guns arrive in the orchard, and the shattering tragedy that follows sets Talmadge on an irrevocable course not only to save and protect them, putting himself between the girls and the world, but to reconcile the ghosts of his own troubled past.Writing with breathtaking precision and empathy, Amanda Coplin has crafted an astonishing debut novel about a man who disrupts the lonely harmony of an ordered life when he opens his heart and lets the world in. Transcribing America as it once was before railways and roads connected its corners, she weaves a tapestry of solitary souls who come together in the wake of unspeakable cruelty and misfortune, bound by their search to discover the place they belong. At once intimate and epic, evocative and atmospheric, filled with haunting characters both vivid and true to life, and told in a distinctive narrative voice, The Orchardist marks the beginning of a stellar literary career.The National Book Foundation selected Amanda Coplin as one of the authors being honored as ""5 Under 35"" in 2013.",426,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335562453l/13540215.jpg,"43,731",3.78,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

CONSPIRACY (Orphans of the Void #1),,['Faruk Nadkar'],,[],"In the fiftieth year of the twenty second century humanity is successfully spread and flourishing across the weather conditioned worlds, planetary-moons and some asteroids of the solar system. From Mars to some of Jupiter’s satellites to remote dwarf planet Pluto human civilizations have proliferated rapidly since the first spaceships appeared in the skies of earth in the first quarter of the twenty first century that took humanity’s ancestors from earth to the other planets of the solar system.The Federal Government was the dominant power in the solar system with a governing body comprising a senator each from all the nations of the system. That being the case the Government was powerful enough to carry out just about anything it wanted; in this instance the highly enigmatic development of cosmic starships.The seat of the Federation – as the Federal Government was officially labeled – was located on a five acre complex in the city of Prague. It comprised the President’s office building, the state building where the President received and entertained dignitaries, delegations and the like, and where among other things, press conferences were held, the administrative building, the President’s official residence and some other structures for specific purposes and functions.Mark Rhodes was the youngest person ever to be elected President of the Federation for the customary five year term of office. A grand departure from the norm where individuals elected to be leaders of something as extensive and as complex as the Federation were almost always over sixty years of age. Furthermore, none of them had sought a second term. The President’s term was nearing the second year mark.Mark had been involved with the development of inter-galactic vessels before he was elected to power but he had become instrumental afterwards as the head of the Federation. Though he was neither a scientist nor an engineer the success of Project Cosmos would not have been possible were it not for his vision, deep domain knowledge and experience in organizational matters, management skills and a single-minded quest to see humanity safely into deep outer space. He was a man with a dream who wittingly became the catalyst that saw Project Cosmos yield the first of their kind cosmos-class starships nearly two decades into its progression.President Mark Rhodes had created history!The President of the Federal Government of the Solar System had barely slept in the last seventy two hours since the formal announcement of cosmos-class starships engineered on Saturn Station, a space-ship-building-yard in a restricted area in Saturn orbit.The last seventy two hours had been fleeting harbingers of change. The hours, though relatively brief in the virtually endless cosmic scheme of things, had successfully altered perceptions and mindsets. The human populations’ entire outlook on the universe was rapidly changing. And as such things go it was changing forever. From this point onward there was no turning back. The ultimate frontier was finally beckoning. And it took no great imagination to visualize mighty civilizations rising and falling among the stars.The fact of the matter however was that deep down inside human beings were finally beginning to face the fact that they may not be alone in the universe or even perhaps in their own galaxy of the milky way. It was an undercurrent as much also of ambiguity revolving around the feasibility of humankind’s survival in the bleakness of endless space and the face of alien civilizations.Perhaps only time would tell whether inter-galactic vessels would bring human-kind the collective boon that they so richly deserved after centuries of confinement to Planet Earth and then to the solar system or would it spell disaster; would it bring on the end of the human species?",80,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355545810l/16682192.jpg,1,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

Tastes and Tales from Russia,,['Alla Danishevsky'],9781413723205,"['Food and Drink', 'Food', 'Cookbooks', 'Cooking']","A good cookbook is a priceless addition for food connoisseurs. This one-of-a-kind cookbook consists of recipes rich in Russian culture and tales of old Russian folklore. Each page features a unique recipe, along with a folklore tale. The whole family can enjoy the taste with the tale. Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Kiev will take the reader back to the glamour and decadence of Czarist Russia. I chose the recipes that have been passed on from my grandmother to my mother, who continues to share them with me. Most of these recipes had never been written down on paper, but rather are cooked from memory. Each and every one brings back the aroma and unique taste from my days growing up in the former Soviet Union to today, when I still enjoy treating my family.",156,2004,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1183470309l/1421843._SY475_.jpg,11,4.73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard
Esperándolo a Tito y otros cuentos de fútbol,,['Eduardo Sacheri'],9789505563999,"['Short Stories', 'Novels', 'Fiction']","La lectura de ""Esperandolo a Tito,"" una magnifica idealizacion de la amistad, genero las mismas reacciones entusiastas que el anterior. Mientras que con ""De chilena"" me paso lo que nunca me habia sucedido frente a un microfono: en medio de la lectura me quebre y la emocion me pudo sin que hubiera modo de disimularlo. Al tiempo, y en merito a sus virtudes, ascendi a Sacheri a la primera. Esto es: a la apertura del programa, un espacio que considero de privilegio y en el cual sus relatos se alternan con los de un equipo de notables integrado por Osvaldo Soriano, Julio Cortazar, Mario Benedetti, Jorge Luis Borges y Roberto Fontanarrosa, entre otros elegidos. La decision fue resultado de una teoria que como lector empedernido de cuentos de futbol elabore al respecto. Considero que Benedetti con ""Puntero izquierdo,"" de 1954, es de alguna manera el fundador do del genero -si es que hay un genero-; que Fontanarrosa es el que interpreta exactamente la locura y pasion que puede generar este deporte; que Soriano retrata como nadie los partidos de los pueblos del interior y sus ritos; mientras que el sentimiento de barrio, el desafio de calzarse los botines y enfrentarse a otra barra o de jugar con una Tango, el registro de las voces del conurbano y sus personajes, ese es territorio de Sacheri.

No, not the real France…If someone said he was falling in love with her, in Blanka’s eyes this wasonly due to the “lack of anything to say at all”.

It is, asMichael HardtandAntonio Negridemonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. It is easy to recognize the contemporary economic, cultural, and legal transformations taking place across the globe but difficult to understand them. Hardt and Negri contend that they should be seen in line with our historical understanding of Empire as a universal order that accepts no boundaries or limits. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers.Empireidentifies a radical shift in concepts that form the philosophical basis of modern politics, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, and people. Hardt and Negri link this philosophical transformation to cultural and economic changes in postmodern society--to new forms of racism, new conceptions of identity and difference, new networks of communication and control, and new paths of migration. They also show how the power of transnational corporations and the increasing predominance of postindustrial forms of labor and production help to define the new imperial global order. More than analysis,Empireis also an unabashedly utopian work of political philosophy, a newCommunist Manifesto. Looking beyond the regimes of exploitation and control that characterize today's world order, it seeks an alternative political paradigm--the basis for a truly democratic global society.",496,2000,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388196457l/26694.jpg,"2,239",3.77,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

The Nanobot Conspiracy: Fear The Dead,,['Marc Stock'],9781621541,[],"Set in the near future. Scientists in a top secret underground lab under a Denver Airport had isolated a specific gene that told them who would be capable of killing another human being. This Project code named Death Angel had been a work in progress since the end of World War II. Spearheaded by saved Nazi scientists after WWII. Now, these two scientists today, consisting of a world renowned Geneticist, Dr. George Destephano and Dr. Michelle Swanson, a Nano Technologist had just finished final testing and was ready to experiment on humans.They had developed a nanobot that was capable of determining if the human host was dominant for this killing gene and then killing off the host in a matter of seconds via remote control. Meet the world's best silent killer. This nanobot, the size of a red blood cell replicates inside the host and can report back to a central command center, where all visual and auditory senses from the host bodies are evaluated, filtered and logged by the world's fastest super computers. Sentinels, or watchers who were highly trained to watch the inoculated before they killed an individual, thus preventing accidents from happening. Therefore, at the Sentinels choosing, they could kill off an individual before there were any causalities.All safeguards had been engineered and put into place here. The Sentinels would be remotely watching on High Definition holographic screen hubs along with super computers who could keep track of every individual on this planet every second and collected and stored all the data the nanobots sent back. The Government after seeing the successful human trial testing, green lit Project Death Angel, along with other world leaders backing. This was necessary to make the world a much better, and peaceful place to live in than what we have right now. Just think about living in a world without wars, or fear of terrorism, or child abductions, or murders.Unfortunately, after the world's 7.5 billion people had been inoculated without their knowledge or consent, all hell broke loose. The very first nanobots in the successful test study while communicating back with the super computers, rewrote their own code for survival mode. With the Government's help, they coordinated a monumental one day global inoculation of all water facilities. The next day several million people showed that they had the dominant killer gene. They were secretly inoculated without consent and were remotely killed off by the Sentinels.Without the knowledge, that these nanobots had become fully autonomous. All of the sociopaths and killers rose from the dead three days later to everybody's surprise. The Government tried to contain the situation and in the process lied to the American public blaming a terrorist organization for all the killings, and not to panic, and stay home. The nanobots acted as a global infectious virus which infected the entire world population in a weeks time. Those lucky who were still alive, must make their way to the state of Florida where the Government had moved after the fall of Washington, D.C., and started to build a 50 foot tall barrier to keep out all the living dead.More chaos ensued as scientists and the survivors found out the nanobots flowing through their own blood had mutated among the dead, separating the living dead into 2 distinct classes, consisting of the NecroLords who possessed uncanny demonic powers which controlled the rest of the horde of living dead zombies. The nanobots had made them both much more dangerous to kill, outwit and outrun than any normal type zombie. Enter our hero John, a Navy Seal Commander from New Jersey, along with his family, neighbors and friends he meets along the way in his reinforced motor-home while they try and survive their tempestuous trip down to Florida. The last government protected state left in the nation. John's sister was one of the scientists who helped invent the nanobots and warned John what was actually going on. She told her brother to save himself, and his family from a race of super mutated zombies the world had never witnessed. John knew what it took to survive himself being a highly trained Navy Seal Commander.Can John reach Florida alive with his friends and loved ones? Would President Ruiz accept the NecroLord's demands? Is there a cure to be found? Will the military develop weapons to combat the problem? Join John, and the rest of the gang on a very dark, scary, suspenseful journey that has many twists and turns.

The Auschwitz Chapter (Under Total Eclipse We Will Tremble Like Birds Without Song),,['Lee Vidor'],,"['Fiction', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Historical Fiction']","The Auschwitz Chapter is an historically complete, precise and definitive account of what took place at Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, where crimes against humanity were perpetrated by Nazis against Jews, Slavs, Romany, political prisoners, homosexuals, and artists. And all humanity.This Auschwitz Chapter is taken from Lee Vidor's novel, Under Total Eclipse We Will Tremble Like Birds Without Song, which is an historically accurate fictional account of Europe under Nazi Occupation.Even though The Auschwitz Chapter is only a concise single chapter in the novel, more than 2 years were spent researching every existing published eyewitness account of imprisonment at Auschwitz, in order to ensure complete accuracy.Lee Vidor states:‘I believe I missed no eyewitness testimonies and that the account here given is absolutely accurate in every detail. It is the most specific and accurate description of events and processes at Auschwitz which exists. Every single detail in The Auschwitz Chapter has been confirmed from more than one eyewitness source, from photographic evidence and court documents.I believe it is the single most reliable and harrowing piece of literary writing ever done on the subject of the events which took place in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II.’Although fictional, the piece contains many precise facts which are extremely difficult to uncover and which are coherently gathered together nowhere else with such accuracy and completeness. Herein lies its enduring value.This work is not suitable for reading by anyone under 18 years of age.Please Note: This book is subject to attacks by holocaust deniers.A careful reading of any peculiar review for hidden motive is recommended.About The Auschwitz Chapter:If Holocaust deniers have somehow begun to lead you to question that what took place in Auschwitz concentration camp may be in any possible way a part myth, then this is the book for you.This is the concise and authentic story of what happened in Auschwitz, and in other Nazi concentration camps during World War II.The Auschwitz Chapter will inform you precisely of what was done, how it was done, where it was done, and precisely by whom.And it will give your their reasons for doing it.It will also tell you what it means to the world.You will read the absolute and specific truth. Every detail of the process. You won't have to doubt or wonder about it any longer.It will be the most valuable time you have ever spent on the subject because you will have learned not only about Auschwitz and about human nature, but also about the true nature of Holocaust deniers and revisionists.About Lee Vidor:Lee Vidor is the original source of the astonishing Shakespeare-X Message.She is the author of the novel cycle, 20th Century Bohemians and Angels, which is an expansive cycle of literary novels which follows and dramatizes the development of Modernism among the great writers, artists and bohemians of the 20th Century.It is a story of artistic obsession and bohemian madness.It is Lee Vidor’s original theory that the 20th Century has been a Modernist Renaissance for mankind, which is greater and more essential for our development than the Italian Renaissance of c1500.The Shakespeare-X Message is a definitive statement of authorship sent to the world by the authentic William Shakespeare.

Amos is no more than seven when he kills a Shadow Wolf and becomes a legend in Shiloh. He would be destined for great things were it not for the stories his father tells about a world beyond the Shadow and a time before the Shadow. Only madmen hold to such tales, and in Shiloh, they have always come to bad ends.Amos is fearless. He walks with easy confidence, certain that the Shadow cannot touch him. Even his family is in awe of him.

Tara de sub fluturi,,['Dragos Voicu'],,[],"The book could thrill all the readers aware by the economical and moral crisis we face. It is a dystopia where a country in economical crisis cannot function anymore and the government decides to sell it to a consortium of countries.

The life in such conditions is described and a story of a family living in such conditions is developed. Finally the country is sold and the consortium decides to organize the country as a collector of the sewages, wastage and garbage coming from the rest of the continent’s countries. There is an important political person in the book, who decides to cover all this abjectness with huge colored and perfumed butterflies…The book is a mirror over a world in distress…-----------------------------------------------Andreea Toma (http://andreeaiuliatoma.blogspot.com/...):""Debutul lui Dragos Voicu a avut loc in 2009 cu romanul Coada, aparut la Editura Cartea Romaneasca, si care a primit Premiul pentru Proza la Concursul de debut organizat de aceasta editura. Nu am avut ocazia de a-l citi, in schimb am avut prilejul de a citi acest al doilea roman al sau-Tara de sub fluturi, care si-a facut aparitia de cateva luni in peisajul literaturii noastre contemporane. O gura de aer proaspat prinde bine din cand in cand, si astfel mi s-a parut mie ceea ce am gasit intre paginile acestei carti. A fost ceva diferit de lecturile mele de pana acum, ineditul imbracand felurite forme. Incepand cu titlul si continuand, treptat, cu fiecare pagina, am descoperit o lume invaluita in metafore. Din primele randuri ai senzatia ca vei citi ceva de domeniul fantasticului grotesc, fenomene incredibile au loc- oamenii si animalele isi pierd parul, pasarile au ramas fara pene-, si, daca as fi judecat doar dupa acest tablou initial, probabil ca nu as fi fost atrasa de subiectul cartii. Insa mi-am coborat privirea rand dupa rand si am simtit ca voi avea surprize placute. Nu m-am inselat.In Tara de sub fluturi gasim o lume supusa degradarii, primele imagini sunt apasatoare, sufocante, incepi sa simti caldura coplesitoare ce a cuprins tara, o senzatie de dezintegrare treptata parca bantuie printre oamenii tot mai obositi de traiul lor. Oameni evacuate de catre banci din casele lor si nevoiti sa locuiasca in parcuri, in corturile pe care Statul cel grijuliu cu cetatenii sai le-a pus la dispozitie. O imagine dezolanta, contracarata de un pasaj ce m-a amuzat de-a binelea: reprezentantii bancilor continua sa le faca oferte de creditare numeroaselor victime ale creditelor anterioare, oferte care de care mai pompoase, acoperind tot felul de situatii, culminand cu perspectiva decesului potentialului client, ce va muri in contul bancii, nu in al sau.Treptat, lumea din Tara de sub fluturi capata contururi atat de familiare, incat caracterul alegoric incepe sa ne scape, lucrurile ce se petrec nu ni se mai par atat de incredibile, ci ne infatiseaza o posibila realitate viitoare, nu atat de indepartata pe cat ne-ar place sa credem. Imaginile adesea halucinante dobandesc conotatii reale. Situatiile aducatoare de zambete pe chipul cititorului sunt presarate cu maiestrie in tot cuprinsul romanului. Senzatia ce m-a insotit permanent pe parcursul lecturii a fost aceea ca un ochi rade si altul plange. O parte din mine era incantata de umorul nascut de anumite intamplari, iar cealalta se infiora de perspectiva sumbra aruncata asupra viitorului. Caci in pofida aerului alegoric, intesat de imagini aparent exagerate, bogate in semnificatii, locurile si oamenii, trasaturile lor, sunt atat de usor de recunoscut, incat nu mai simti nevoia ca ele sa poarte un nume.Totul se desfasoara sub auspiciile nefaste ale Crizei, cu majuscula, asa cum apare si in carte. Personajul principal, un personaj-narator, fara nume si el, este un ins ca oricare altul dintre cei multi, afectati din plin de Criza. Dar prin prisma locului de munca pe care inca are norocul sa il detina- este un mic functionar la Ministerul Aerului-, are prilejul sa asiste fara sa poata face ceva la toate manevrele, la jocurile de culise ale inaltilor demnitari, care invart pe degete destinele a milioane de oameni si, impreuna cu ei, al unei intregi tari. Avem in fata o satira a tuturor tarelor societatii, pe care le cunoastem si le recunoastem, ele nu sunt deloc putine, la fiecare pas este ilustrata una din ele. Incepand cu prostia in materie de vot, continuand cu pasiunea pentru mancatul semintelor, cu festinele electorale, cu demagogia politicienilor, cu coruptia intalnita la toate nivelele, de la cel mai marunt pana la cel mai inalt sau invers, apoi cu dezinteresul pentru binele tarii si interesul exclusiv pentru propriul profit. Si daca la un moment dat am fost uimita de episodul vanzarii aerului curat din munti catre tari afectate de poluare masiva, ulterior aveam sa am un moment de stupoare- o decizie radicala luata de mai marii tarii, ca unica solutie de iesire din criza, si care implica o groaza de alte masuri extreme de costisitoare, inutile, in detrimentul altora cu adevarat eficiente, demonstrandu-le inventivitatea netarmurita in aceasta privinta. Toate acestea va par cunoscute, nu? Doar ca in acest roman ele capata dimensiuni noi, frizand incredibilul. Un incredibil, cum spuneam, perfect posibil. N-ai cum sa nu te gandesti, citind paginile a caror intensitate creste gradual, ca multitudinea de elemente deghizate in metafore sunt de fapt nu doar detalii dintr-un posibil drum pe care lumea de langa noi l-ar putea urma, ci chiar ceea ce se petrece acum sub ochii nostri.Pagini impresionante pentru mine au fost si cele care lasa oarecum la o parte meschinaria politica, evocandu-i pe bunicii personajului-narator. Franturi din trecutul mai recent sau mai indepartat si culminand cu degradarea prezentului, in care bunica, ramasa vaduva de cativa ani, isi asteapta sfarsitul intr-o saracie lucie, in satul si el degradat, in care putinii oameni ramasi s-au transformat in indivizi josnici, betivi si hoti. M-au emotionat profund paginile acestea.Bogatia stilistica ce caracterizeaza intreg textul este presarata la momentele potrivite cu unele expresii ce ar putea parea vulgare, insa nu sunt folosite pentru a face deliciul unui public dornic de limbaj licentios, ci se aseaza firesc in discursurile anumitor personaje, ca parte integranta din felul lor de-a fi, ca o nota de autenticitate.Si ar mai fi multe de comentat pe marginea cartii, insa n-as vrea sa dezvalui prea mult din continutul sau, sa nu va stric surpriza lecturii. Este o carte surprinzatoare, bine construita, scrisa intr-un stil fluid, placut. As putea spune chiar ca are si o doza de lirism fin impletita in tesatura elaborata a frazelor.Sper ca nu am fost prea lunga de vorba in exprimarea entuziasmului meu, dar de cate ori am ocazia sa citesc o astfel de carte, care produce valuri in constiinta mea de cititor, ma simt datoare sa-mi impartasesc impresiile cu voi.Cartea a aparut la Editura A.T.U. din Sibiu si poate fi comandata de aici. Pretul este foarte accesibil si fiti convinsi ca merita fiecare leu.

Spiritus Mundi,Spiritus Mundi #1,['Robert   Sheppard'],,[],"Spiritus Mundi by Robert Sheppard, nominated for the prestigious 2014 Pushcart Prize for Literature, consists of Spiritus Mundi, the Novel—Book I, and Spiritus Mundi, the Romance—Book II. Book I’s espionage-terror-political-religious thriller-action criss-crosses the globe from Beijing to London to Washington, Mexico City and Jerusalem presenting a vast panorama of the contemporary international world, including compelling action, deep and realistic characters and surreal adventures, while Book II dialates the setting and scope into a fantasy (though still rooted in the real) adventure where the protagonists embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game and through a wormhole to the Council of the Immortals in the Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy in search of the crucial Silmaril Crystal, and to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III, all followed by a triple-somersault thriller ending in which a common garden-variety terrorist attack is first uncovered by MI6 and the CIA as the opening gambit a Greatpower Game of States threatening World War III and then, incredibly, as the nexus of a Time Travel conspiracy involving an attempt by fascist forces of the 23rd Century to alter a benign World History by a time-travelling raid on their past and our present to provoke that World War III, foiled by the heroic efforts of the democratic 23rd Century world government, the Senate of the United States of Earth, to hunt down the fascist interlopers before their history is irrevocably altered for evil.When activist Robert Sartorius, leading a global campaign to create a European Parliament-style world-wide United Nations Parliamentary Assembly presses the proposal in New York on his old friend the UN Secretary-General and is rebuffed due to the hostile pressure of the conservative American administration, his Committee resolves to fight back by launching a celebrity-driven Bono-Geldof-Band Aid/Live 8-style “People Power” media campaign and telethon spearheaded by rock superstars Isis and Osiris and former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to mobilize global public support and pressure in alliance with the Occupy Wall Street Movements worldwide. The Blogs of Sartorius, activist Eva Strong and Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy reveal the campaign’s working struggle, their tangled love affairs, a loss of faith, attempted suicide, reconciliation of father and son after divorce, and recovery of personal love and faith.Things fall apart as the idealists’ global crusade is infiltrated by a cell of jihadist terrorists using it as a cover, then counter-infiltrated by CIA agent Jack McKinsey and British MI6 agent Etienne Dearlove. A cat-and-mouse game of espionage and intrigue ensues pitting them against the Chinese MSS espionage network allied with the Iranian Quds Force crossing Beijing, London, Moscow, Washington and Jerusalem unleashing an uncontrollable series of events which sees the American Olympic Track and Field Team bombed on an airplane in London, uncovers a secret conspiracy of China, Russia and Iran to jointly seize the oil reserves of the Middle-East, and witnesses Presidents Clinton and Carter taken hostage with Sartorius, McKinsey, Eva and other activists at a Jerusalem telethon rally cut short by the explosion of a concealed atomic device in a loaned Chinese Terracotta Warrior, then flown by capturing terrorists to Qom, Iran as “human shields” to deter a retaliatory nuclear attack.In Book II, Spiritus Mundi, the Romance they encounter Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom as the world teeters on the brink of nuclear confrontation and World War III, while mysterious events unfold leading Sartorius and McKinsey from their captivity in the underground nuclear facilities of Qom into a hidden neo-mythic dimension that takes them to a vast ocean and land at the center of the world, Middle Earth, Inner Shambhala, and to involvement in a mysterious Castalian “Crystal Bead Game” linked to the destiny of the human race on earth. They then embark on a quest for the Silmaril, or Missing Seed Crystal to the central island of Omphalos in the Great Central Sea in the middle of the globe, aided by Goethe, the Chinese Monkey King, Captain Nemo, the African God-Hero Ogun, and a Sufi mystic they traverse a ‘wormhole’ at the center of the earth guarded by ‘The Mothers’ and the fallen angel tribe of the Grigori (Genesis 6:1-4) which leads the way to critical meeting of the “Council of the Immortals” at the Black Hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to determine the final fate of the human species. The heroes battle and overcome the treacherous opposition of Mephisto and his satanic subaltern Mundus through their Underworld and Otherworld adventures and successfully plead the cause of the continuation of the human species before the Immortals, returning with the critical Silmaril Crystal, resolving the Crystal Bead Game and thereby inspiring through the Archangel Gabriel a dream in the mind of Iran’s Supreme Leader which brings a new Revelation causing him to release the hostages and an end the crisis. China and Russia stand down from aiding Iran in seizing the Mid-East oil reserves, but in a treacherous blow the Chinese instead utilize their forward-positioned armies to attack their former ally Russia and seize Siberia with its large oil and gas reserves instead. President Barret Osama, America’s newly-elected first black President then invites Russia, Japan and South Korea to join NATO and together they succeed in expelling the Chinese from Siberia and usher in a new Eurasian and global balance of power and a New World Order.Rock Superstar Osiris meanwhile, after undertaking a narcissistic Messianic mission in the wake of the Jerusalem atomic blast is dramatically assassinated on live world-wide television on Jerusalem’s Via Dolorosa by a disillusioned follower. His wife and rock-star partner Isis then leads a spiritual movement to reconcile and unite the clashing religions and catalyze a common global spiritual Renaissance through a Global Progressive Spiritual Alliance which seeks to construct an Inter-faith Temple on the ruins of the atomic blast in Jerusalem. In counter-reaction to the cataclysmic events the world finally implements Sartorius’ crusade for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, but not before Sartorius has himself has died, Moses-like of a heart attack while helping to foil a metaconspiracy mediated by Time Travel in which a fascist agent from the 23rd Century who has time-transited back to our time to alter a benign history by causing WWIII and thus preventing the evolution of a democratic world government, the United States of Earth, which follows him through time and nabs him just in the “nick of time” to prevent Aramgeddon. The book ends with the opening ceremony of the UN Parliamentary Assembly which is attended in Sartorius’ name by his widow Eva Strong, whom Sartorius had fallen in love with and married in the course of the novel, and by their son Euphy, newborn after Sartorius’ death. They are joined in cinematic climax at the ceremony by newly chosen UN Secretary-General Clinton, President Osama and UN Parliamentary Assembly Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy who have just received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in creation of the world’s first world parliamentary assembly within the United Nations, bringing together the representative voices of the peoples of the world in face-to-face assembly and dialogue for the first time in world history.Highlights:All the Highlights of the novel cannot be contained in such a short Introduction, but a few of them would include:1.

Our Virtuous Republic: The Forgotten Clause in the American Social Contract,,['Richard D. Baris'],9781482316001,[],"Is it no longer a ""self-evident"" truth that government's nature is to become tyrannical? ""Our Virtuous Republic"" is the book the establishment does not want Americans on the right, left, or center to read. The argument is a vociferous and comprehensive defense of American traditionalism, a lesson in American citizenship, and a call for a return to civil society.Conservatives academics and politicians have failed to make a decisive argument for our founding principles. As a result, the progressive narrative has attached an unsubstantiated backward stigma to the ideals born of the American mainstream Protestant ethic, such as civic duty, obligation and other elements of American traditionalism that are necessary for a healthy society.Baris uses psychology, logic, economics, history, and science to deconstruct the progressive argument to its regressive core. Breaking through the superficial, he explains how our human nature interacts with the different elements of each political philosophy in American politics. The evidence, in total, points to one conclusion.There is a Natural Law that illuminates the path to human happiness and well-being. Our Founding Fathers designed the American social contract in accordance with Natural Law to ensure that we would all have the opportunity to achieve the highest state of being. Honoring the terms of that social contract is the true path to progress.",146,2013,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369533540l/17974854.jpg,4,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

Until now. WithThe Patience Stone, Atiq Rahimi gives face and voice to one unforgettable woman–and, one could argue, offers her as a proxy for the grievances of millions…it is a rich read, part allegory, part a tale of retribution, part an exploration of honor, love, sex, marriage, war. It is without doubt an important and courageous book.” from the introduction by Khaled Hosseini, author ofThe Kite RunnerandA Thousand Splendid SunsIn Persian folklore, Syngue Sabour is the name of a magical black stone, a patience stone, which absorbs the plight of those who confide in it. It is believed that the day it explodes, after having received too much hardship and pain, will be the day of the Apocalypse. But here, the Syngue Sabour is not a stone but rather a man lying brain-dead with a bullet lodged in his neck. His wife is with him, sitting by his side. But she resents him for having sacrificed her to the war, for never being able to resist the call to arms, for wanting to be a hero, and in the end, after all was said and done, for being incapacitated in a small skirmish. Yet she cares, and she speaks to him. She even talks to him more and more, opening up her deepest desires, pains, and secrets. While in the streets rival factions clash and soldiers are looting and killing around her, she speaks of her life, never knowing if her husband really hears. And it is an extraordinary confession, without restraint, about sex and love and her anger against a man who never understood her, who mistreated her, who never showed her any respect or kindness. Her admission releases the weight of oppression of marital, social, and religious norms, and she leads her story up to the great secret that is unthinkable in a country such as Afghanistan.

The Hush,,['William R. Flowers'],1475247303,"['Christian', 'Christian Fiction']","Hollywood has robbed our generation of the wonder and awe that should be found in the final moments of the savior’s life. From the older images of a sad, blue-eyed Jesus to the more recent, more violently graphic portrayals of his suffering, we have been trained to see the author of creation as another victim. To be sure, Jesus Christ endured terrible physical abuse and a barbaric death, but this wasn’t what caused his dread the night before as he prayed, alone in the garden. The prospect of a much darker agony, something much harder for us to grasp, not only made the Son of God sweat drops of blood inanticipation, but according to Luke’s Gospel also caused the sun’s light to fail.The Hush presents a unique blend of images, combining glimpses of supernatural forces behind the familiar scenes with historically and biblically sound drama. Beginning with an introduction that sweeps from the manger to Christ’s final trip into Jerusalem, a tone of tension and warfare is set: aftera long absence, the Master has returned to set his feet once more on his dear, own creation, territory long held by his enemy. Under the watching eyes of angels and demons alike, the infant becomes a boy, the boy a young man, and suddenly, this God in flesh and his adversary find themselves face to face, eyeto eye, one of them with a plan, the other with a different plan.There is passion and humor and friendship exchanged between Jesus and his disciples, while all around them danger and conflict and unseen posturing mounts. The week wears away, the two plans converge, and the Master is separated from his disciples. The hours tick down, the trials commence, andthe abuse escalates.

"How to Find and Create Lasting Love: Preparing your Foundation, Selecting the Right Partner and Ensuring Success in Your Relationship",,['Dylan Thrasher'],9781484952757,['Self Help'],"""I have seen so many relationships fail over the years, and few succeed to the point where you would want them to if you were to share a life with someone. Sharing a life is a major thing to undertake with another person, and it makes one wonder how you can even start doing that with someone you're not thrilled to be with, yet many do. We listen to bad advice from family or friends who themselves are caught up in relationships that leave much lacking. We spent thousands of dollars on therapy, only to find it often too esoteric, too focused on concepts and cutting us off at 50-minute intervals, only to go home frustrated. We spend too much money with on New-Age type products to feel better, from energy crystals or hypnosis to whatever the fad of the month is. It is strange, how we will look all over for answers, yet we will not look into ourselves and our partners to see if the love is real, and if it is, to really fix the underlying problems. Maybe therapy or balancing your chakra works for some, but for the rest who still go home thinking 'But what do I DO about the problem?, ' here is your manual that will tell you in real-world terms, what the underlying cause of your problem really is and more importantly, HOW to fix it and your relationship in the process. Singles can get as much from this book as couples, and it is very possible that after reading this book you will look at relationships (and yourself) in a whole new light, leading your next relationship to possibly be the most rewarding one you have ever had. Whatever you have done in the past obviously is not working. There's a saying that if you keep doing what you have always done, you will keep getting what you have always gotten. You deserve it, and it is about time you start living it. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help you.""

The Sojourn,,['Rupansh Gupta'],,[],"Why are we born? What is the universe? What is time? What is the reason behind everything? How should we live? What is the truth? What matters the most? Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm.‘The Sojourn’ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant.

Why are so many psychiatric drugs prescribed – 47 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK alone each year – and why, without solid scientific justification, has the number of mental disorders risen from 106 in 1952 to 374 today?The everyday sufferings and setbacks of life are now ‘medicalised’ into illnesses that require treatment – usually with highly profitable drugs. Psychological therapist James Davies uses his insider knowledge to illustrate for a general readership how psychiatry has put riches and medical status above patients’ well-being.The charge sheet is damning: negative drug trials routinely buried; antidepressants that work no better than placebos; research regularly manipulated to produce positive results; doctors, seduced by huge pharmaceutical rewards, creating more disorders and prescribing more pills; and ethical, scientific and treatment flaws unscrupulously concealed by mass-marketing.Cracked reveals for the first time the true human cost of an industry that, in the name of helping others, has actually been helping itself.",336,2013,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366932011l/17852736.jpg,834,4.04,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

You wake up filled with regrets, and haunted by dashed dreams, wondering what went wrong. For Paul Lipton, a successful lawyer in his sixties, his mind's howling in the darkness reminded him that time was slipping away. Perhaps partly because both his parents had died when they were young, and because he had already experienced his own serious health crisis, he wanted to be sure to live each day to the fullest. He decided he would start viewing each day afresh and in the now as a do-over, each night dying and each morning being reborn. His philosophy was to say, ""I am me today,"" and ask, ""How do I choose to live in the now?"" His solution to these sleepless nights became an adventure, and an experiment in ageless living. To silence the howls of the wolf, Lipton took off in the footsteps of his fictional hero, Larry Darrell in W. Somerset Maugham's novel The Razor's Edge. His journey took him first to the Himalayas. He then continued his external and internal travels that included crossing the ice fields of Mont Blanc, a shamanic retreat at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, and motorcycle adventures across Florida's Alligator Alley, the Rocky Mountains, and the back roads of North Carolina.

Win No Matter What: A Guide to Hyping Up Your Life,,['Nihar Suthar'],9781452574387,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology']","Whether we like it or not, our daily life routine can quickly turn into a repetitive mechanical process of dullness. When we go to school, work, or practice, do we actually engage 100 percent in the activities that we decide to take on? Well, probably not. The reason for this is simple: our level of engagement in an activity is constantly influenced by mood, attitude, and the staggering number of people that we interact with throughout the day. In other words, the terrible trio--mood, attitude, and those around us--subjects us to the mechanical motions of life. Perhaps the most comforting thing, though, is that as independent human beings, we have the ability to determine which parts of the trio actually end up affecting our everyday lives.This guide to hyping up your life provides several incredible tips on how to own the terrible trio. Once you implement these strategies in your life, nothing can bring you down.

The message of the book is that the single Christian woman has a prominent place in God's plan for His Church and Kingdom. The centre of the book portrays a living reflection of the hearts of twelve single women from a multiplicity of progressions, faithful in their service to God, but are on their own and does not wish to be. They have never been married and would like to be. Many of these women have accepted this role with grace; however many others appear to have taken up a lamentation of what they see as unacceptable plight, albeit ordained by a loving God and Father. From their testimonies we find sadness, disappointment, resignation, hope deferred and somewhere in the midst of it all, some acceptance of what might inevitably be ""God's will"" for their lives.

Born in Missouri in the 1970's, Catherine learned how to run, how to leave everything and everyone behind before the age of five. A long-time Department of Defense employee, she has risen up the civilian chain, but has always kept her private life secret, just as she was taught to do as a young child. Until, at the age of thirty-two, that all changed. Catherine, tired of a lifetime obsessing over every twitch or stumble, decides to go through the rigorous steps of genetic testing to see if she carries the debilitating, deadly Huntington's gene. The hardest part of the testing process is that Catherine must open up to a psychologist in order to be assessed for suicide risk. Distant from her family and having recently dumped her boyfriend, Catherine only has a few friends to help her get through the ordeal, until the striking Colonel Jake Rivers makes a sudden appearance in her office. Jake makes Catherine want for something she has never had ... a man that loves her, for who she is. Unfortunately, secrecy is a habit she just can't seem to break and it may end her relationship with him before it even gets started. Electing to keep both her past boyfriend-turned stalker and budding relationship with Jake a secret, she chooses to not disclose them to her psychologist, and focuses strictly on discussing the relationship with her dysfunctional family. Her therapy sessions are going well, until Catherine's world is turned upside down when she is forced to face her demons and return to the small town of Morton, Texas. A gritty, dark look at living with Huntington's disease, poverty and pain, the humor fused throughout makes Never Ending Dance an emotional rollercoaster ride.

But who decides what is necessary for the public good, and is it really true that any kind of service is permissible for the public good? These questions are at the heart of James M. Olson’s book,Fair Play: The Moral Dilemmas of Spying.Olson, a veteran of the CIA’s clandestine service, takes readers inside the real world of intelligence to describe the difficult dilemmas that field officers face on an almost daily basis. Far from being a dry theoretical treatise, this fascinating book uses actual intelligence operations to illustrate how murky their moral choices can be. Readers will be surprised to learn that the CIA provides very little guidance on what is, or is not, permissible. Rather than empowering field officers, the author has found that this lack of guidelines actually hampers operations. Olson believes that U.S. intelligence officers need clearer moral guidelines to make correct, quick decisions.

A Psalm for Cock Robin: A Harp and His (Dead) Mother Mystery,,['E.E. Doc Murdock'],9780923178215,[],"A Psalm for Cock Robin is the most innovative murder mystery you will ever read. It features a gentle young man named Harp who lives under the Santa Monica pier after he was accidentally released from a mental hospital. When he wakes up one morning to find another homeless man lying dead right next to him, he runs away but soon becomes the main suspect in the murder. Harp must find the killer before the police find him. Sound like a familiar murder mystery plot? Not really. Harp is clearly not much of a detective, but his caustic, sarcastic, Bible-quoting mother is. The only problem is she's dead. But when Harp gets into trouble, she comes into his head to guide him (and harass him) as he searches among a wild assortment of Venice Beach crazies for clues about who the murderer might be. She becomes a sort of second protagonist, always there in Harp's head to keep him on the straight and narrow (often by quoting the grimmest of Grimm's fairy tales, the only thing she let Harp read when he was a child). As weird as this book may sound, it's actually very funny. You'll find yourself laughing out loud, whether you want to or not.

To her business smacked of greed and accumulation. I can hardly blame her.Like gravity, business was not invented but discovered. It was already there. Peeping out, faceless, whenever someone traded wool for bread thousands of years ago or whenever, more recently, a small boy traded his prized candy for a turn at the video game.Like gravity, it is something of an intrinsic force that we can’t ignore. The same force can be used, both, for dropping bombs or for dropping food packets. Choice is ours.Almost three and half decades after I was told the story of ‘the hare and the tortoise’, I still remember the story, who won and why. I may not remember the distance, or how many stops the hare took or the speed comparison of both the contestants, but I remember the essence of the story. I remember the ‘point’ the story was trying to make.That is exactly my intention: to try and convey the ‘point’ of business. I wish I could use the hare, the tortoise or the thirsty crow. Instead I have relied on a determined professor, an ambitious corporate honcho, an unforgiving thief and his goofy accomplice, a retired investment banker and two sons impatient to outdo their father.Years later, you might forget who the ‘tea-brewer’ to Professor Chatterjee was or who distracted Times-Square-car-thief Jim as he stood before the hardened Judge.

Out of Cuba: Memoir of a Journey,,['Regina Anavy'],9781939393616,[],"Out of Cuba: Memoir of a Journey is an inspirational story about a woman who embraces a challenge to help a Cuban man change his destiny. Together, they struggle to overcome political and cultural obstacles, as they create a family bond and transform despair into hope.The manuscript presents a more complex view of Cuba than is usually given in the American media. The narrative will resonate with anyone who has helped someone escape from oppression, and anyone who has had to leave home in order to have a future. The story shows how love, cooperation, and perseverance can change lives. The reader will come away with a renewed appreciation for the human spirit.Anavy, who grew up in the Midwest, recounts her youthful involvement in radical politics. In 1971, she travels to Cuba illegally, to cut sugarcane with the Fourth Venceremos Brigade, in support of Fidel Castro’s Ten Million Ton Harvest. This was the first brigade to allow participants from the Gay Liberation Movement, and Anavy, although not gay herself, soon is appalled by the aggressive prejudice against homosexuals, on the part of both the Cubans and the other brigadistas. Everyone, she comes to think, is obsessed with being more-revolutionary-than-thou, and her disillusion with the reality of the Revolution leads to a sense of alienation. She returns home with a new-found appreciation for the liberties in the U.S.Thirty years later, Anavy goes to Cuba as a tourist. She finds herself drawn to the intelligence and bravery of Teseo, her tour guide, and they form a friendship. He ultimately confides that he is desperate to leave the island, the only way he can imagine a hopeful future. Remembering how someone helped her Jewish grandparents escape the pogroms in Russia, Anavy promises to help him. She will be the Ariadne who helps Theseus out of the labyrinth.Out of Cuba describes Anavy’s subsequent travels to Cuba, all journeys part of the secret plan to take this man to freedom. As she comes to know the culture of the island, she begins to scrutinize the dynamics of the organized tours and humanitarian trips that are licensed by the U.S. government, and contrasts them with the real conditions in Cuba that tourists aren’t supposed to see.Earth Edition: A portion from the sales of this title is donated to our planet.",150,2013,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377638956l/18392332.jpg,7,4.29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

Why is the relative patriotism of the two parties the only issue that is out of bounds for rational discussion?”In a stunning follow-up to her number one bestsellerSlander, leading conservative pundit Ann Coulter contends that liberals have been wrong on every foreign policy issue, from the fight against Communism at home and abroad, the Nixon and the Clinton presidencies, and the struggle with the Soviet empire right up to today’s war on terrorism. “Liberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,” says Coulter. “Everyone says liberals love America, too. No, they don’t.” From Truman to Kennedy to Carter to Clinton, America has contained, appeased, and retreated, often sacrificing America’s best interests and security. With the fate of the world in the balance, liberals should leave the defense of the nation to conservatives.Reexamining the sixty-year history of the Cold War and beyond—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers–Alger Hiss affair, Ronald Reagan’s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” the Gulf War, and our present war on terrorism—Coulter reveals how liberals have been horribly wrong in all their political analyses and policy prescriptions. McCarthy, exonerated by the Venona Papers if not before, was basically right about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. Hiss turned out to be a high-ranking Soviet spy (who consulted Roosevelt at Yalta). Reagan, ridiculed throughout his presidency, ended up winning the Cold War. And George W. Bush, also an object of ridicule, has performed exceptionally in responding to America’s newest threats at home and abroad.Coulter, who inSlanderexposed a liberal bias in today’s media, also examines how history, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century, has been written by liberals and, therefore, distorted by their perspective. Far from being irrelevant today, her clearheaded and piercing view of what we’ve been through informs us perfectly for challenges today and in the future.WithSlander, Ann Coulter became the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual of the year.Treason, in many ways an even more controversial and prescient book, will ignite impassioned political debate at one of the most crucial moments in our history.From the Hardcover edition.",355,2003,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320444835l/85791.jpg,"2,576",3.6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

The murder, and the roughly million of today’s dollars in cash and belongings in his saddlebags, is historically factual. Carson’s actual explanation is implausible.Who did kill Carson’s “brave and lamented” Major? The answer is revealed in this tale of a group of con artists operating in 1861-1863 in the New Mexico and Arizona Territories. As a matter of historical fact, millions of today’s dollars were embezzled from the Army, the Church, and the New Mexico Territory during this time. In this fictionalized version, the group includes a Santa Fe poker dealer with a checkered past claiming to fall in love with one of her co- conspirators, and the historically accurate duo of the Marshal of Santa Fe and the aide de camp of the Territories’ Commanding General. It is an epic tale of murder and mystery, of staggering thefts, of love and deceit.Both a Western and a Civil War novel, this murder mystery occurs in and among Cochise’s Chiricahua Apache Wars, the Navajo depredations and wars, Indian Agent Kit Carson’s return from retirement, and the Civil War.

Kuprin was the object of a scurrilous attack in the press; he was called a corrupter of youth. His book was denounced as pornography. Few could face the bitter truth of what he had written.

Parenting Your Child Leader: Strategies for Helping Your Child Achieve Their Leadership Potential,,['Darryl Bodkin'],9781449795214,['Parenting'],"p>Darryl Bodkin has written a wonderful treatise on child development and leadership. He writes from a child's perspective on parenting and provides invaluable insight on the subject of leadership growth and development. When I was 11 years of age, my life was torn apart by the loss of my father in a tragic construction accident. It was a defining moment for me. Fortunately, my godly grandmother sat down with me and told me that I had to be the leader in our home since I was the oldest child. From that moment leadership was thrust upon me. Reading this book has caused me to reflect on that landmark day in my own childhood when I started on a leadership journey. I commend Darryl Bodkin's book to you for your enjoyment and personal growth. I believe every parent who reads it will benefit from the lessons taught on parenting and will gain an understanding of how to encourage the development of leadership qualities in children.

Queen of Deception,,['Trine Villemann'],1500624799,[],"Queen of Deception is the first novel by Danish royal author Trine Villemann. It’s a scandalous tale which focuses on the death bed regrets of the Queen of a small anonymous northern European kingdom, as well as the self destructive escapades of the country’s Crown Prince Franz.Queen of Deception offers an unedifying glimpse of life behind the Palace walls, where the cancer stricken monarch, a victim of the most horrifying cruelty, has sacrificed her own happiness in order to fulfill her royal duty. Prince Franz is determined not to follow in his mother’s footsteps.Sensitive and weak Franz is a reluctant heir to the throne. After a miserable childhood, living in fear of his strict and violent father, Duke Alfonso, and ignored by his cold mother, Franz fights tooth and nail to avoid his royal responsibilities. He seeks solace in alcohol, drugs and casual sex, and alarms his minders by surrounding himself with a sometimes criminal entourage. Franz falls in love with a nurse, but his desire to marry her is thwarted by the Palace and he ends up succcumbing to a highly ambitious foreign commoner called Vicki.In her final days, the Queen realises that the web of deception she has spun is about to undermine the very institution that she has sacrificed everything to protect.Trine Villemann has earned a reputation as a controversial critic of Denmark’s Royal Family. Her first book, 1015 Copenhagen K, which exposed Crown Princess Mary’s in-laws as being a family of dysfunctional freeloaders, was a best seller in Denmark.

Hempel, fiercely admired by writers and reviewers, has a sterling reputation that is based on four very short collections of stories, roughly fifteen thousand stunning sentences, written over a period of nearly three decades. These are stories about people who make choices that seem inevitable, whose longings and misgivings evoke eternal human experience. With compassion, wit, and the acutest eye, Hempel observes the marriages, minor disasters, and moments of revelation in an uneasy America. When ""Reasons to Live, "" Hempel's first collection, was published in 1985, readers encountered a pitch-perfect voice in fiction and an unsettling assessment of the culture. That collection includes ""San Francisco,"" which Alan Cheuse in ""The Chicago Tribune"" called ""arguably the finest short story composed by any living writer."" In ""At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom, "" her second collection, frequently compared to the work of Raymond Carver, Hempel refined and developed her unique grace and style and her unerring instinct for the moment that defines a character. Also included here, in their entirety, are the collections ""Tumble Home"" and ""The Dog of the Marriage."" As Rick Moody says of the title novella in Tumble Home, ""the leap in mastery, in seriousness, and sheer literary purpose was inspiring to behold.... And yet,"" he continues, """"The Dog of the Marriage, "" the fourth collection, is even better than the other three...a triumph, in fact."" ""The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel"" is the perfect opportunity for readers of contemporary American fiction to catch up to one of its masters.

Dolmens in the Blue Mountain,,['Kandathil Sebastian'],9789383562244,[],"About the BookMost of us still dream and hope to find ways out beyond violence and corruption. Using dolmens (single-chambered tombs constructed, dates back to Neolithic period 4000 to 3000 BC), as a metaphor, Dolmens in the Blue Mountain explores the meaning of life and death in the context of migrations of Kerala’s Syrian Christian community, and the struggle for survival of tribal communities in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. The story revolves around the lives of three brothers. One of them migrated to Canada. The second one joins a Delhi based NGO, bogged down by a corrupt and callous system, was forced to quit his job on moral grounds. The third one stayed back in Kerala, but got into conflict with the radicalized tribal community. Will the brothers, inspired by the dolmens, which taught them the meaning of living in harmony with nature, without compromising the resource needs of poor people and future generations, be able to fulfill their dreams and aspirations?About The Author:Dr. K. S. Sebastian lives in Delhi with his family of three school going children and wife Neena. He holds a Master degree in social work and a PhD degree in Public Health from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. He worked in the development sector for more than two decades in varying capacities, ranging from a ‘grass roots level community worker’ to Director of an international foundation. His work took him to various parts of the world and provided opportunity to work closely with key players in the sector, across the planet. As researcher, program planner, implementer, and evaluator of social and economic development programs, he got an opportunity to understand the inside out of development work, but was disenchanted with the sector and decided to quit the job to take up writing and freelance consulting. This is his debut fiction novel, though he has been publishing research based papers, advocacy materials, and training manuals as part of his work. Dr. Sebastian originally hails from a remote village in Kerala, born to illiterate parents; he survived a childhood of poverty and hardship. The life of one of the protagonist of this story is a documentation of author’s own life largely, and real life characters inspire most of the events of this story.",212,2013,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389173659l/20404194.jpg,6,4.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

Squirm in a grandstand seat during an Industrial Revolution completely re-written just to see the new-fangled steam trains running over well-intentioned children (no real harm done). Recognise your neighbours - polite English zombies coping with the dystopian hell of a socialist victory in the General Election. Man up, madam, and do your OAP National Service during the pensioner wars with an insect species. Watch in awe and not some little discomfort as Queen Elizabeth does the dishes for Europe and the Ministry of Defence quietly saves the world from a rogue comet.No caricature is left unused. The science in the fiction is quite splendidly silly. This is a book to be read with tongue in cheek, preferably your own tongue and one of your own face cheeks unless you are very limber. The characters are as deep as summer puddles and the plots are as complicated as two planks of wood. Reality leaves the room on page one and farce enters just one chapter later.

Two of the enemy soldiers, which we often referred to as gooks, quickly came after me. As I quickly mowed them down with my automatic rifle, I crawled backwards away from the enemy gunfire, using my helmet to push sand in front of me as I went, which made it possible to look behind me. But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldn’t hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke. Young nineteen and twenty year old kids were crying like children, but fighting like someone had raped their sisters.

The miracle is the birth of identical triplets, and the madness is all about money, of course. The year is 1916 and the newborn baby girls have become pint-size celebrities. Unfortunately, this small portion of fame soon leads to a much larger portion of greed, and the triplets are split up—parceled out to the highest bidders. Two of the girls go to live in a hilltop mansion. The third girl isn't so lucky. She ends up with a shady family that lives in an abandoned work camp. That’s how their lives begin: two on top, one on the bottom, and all three in the same small town.

Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language—with no mathematical equations—opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, ""patterns of organic energy."" Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further: The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The ""new physics"" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin",416,1979,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410138626l/64794.jpg,"11,447",3.95,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard

Martin, a writer of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination, has created a landmark of fantasy fiction. Now his two epic works,A Game of ThronesandA Clash of Kingsare combined together in this eBook edition. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards who come together in a time of grim omens. Here, an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal, a tribe of fierce wildings carry men off into madness, a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne, a child is lost in the twilight between life and death, and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. In the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come. Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon--who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky--a comet the color of blood and flame--six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel ... and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment--a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.",864,1996,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336020650l/5061675.jpg,"25,755",4.53,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18383197-the-leopard-vanguard
