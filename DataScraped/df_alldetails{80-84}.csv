A Kidnapping in Milan: The CIA on Trial,,['Steve Hendricks'],9780393065817,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Cultural', 'International', 'War', 'Terrorism']","As propulsively readable as the best “true crime,”A Kidnapping in Milanis a potent reckoning with the realities of counterterrorism. In a mesmerizing page-turner, Steve Hendricks gives us a ground-level view of the birth and growth of international Islamist terrorist networks and of counterterrorism in action in Europe. He also provides an eloquent, eagle’s-eye perspective on the big questions of justice and the rule of law.“In Milan a known fact is always explained by competing stories,” Hendricks writes, but the stories that swirled around the February 2003 disappearance of the radical imam Abu Omar would soon point in one direction—to a covert action by the CIA. The police of Milan had been exploiting their wiretaps of Abu Omar for useful information before the taps went silent. The Americans were their allies in counterterrorism—would they have disrupted a fruitful investigation?In an extraordinary tale of detective versus spy, Italian investigators under the leadership of prosecutor Armando Spataro unraveled in embarrassing detail the “covert” action in which Abu Omar had been kidnapped and sent to be tortured in Egypt. Spataro—seasoned in prosecutions of the Mafia and the Red Brigades and a passionate believer in the rule of law—sought to try the kidnappers in absentia: the first-ever trial of CIA officers by a U.S. ally. An exemplary achievement in narrative nonfiction writing,A Kidnapping in Milanis at once a detective story, a history of the terrorist menace, and an indictment of the belief that man’s savagery against man can be stilled with more savagery yet.",320,2010,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348410300l/8252686.jpg,71,3.38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Antidisestablishmentarianism,,"['Michael J. Findley', 'Mary C. Findley']",9780983030,[],"The Bible is a Book of ScienceSecular Humanism is a Religion of MythologyAntidisestablishmentarianism is a word you might have kidded your friends with in your school days. People once thought of it as the longest word in English, but that's probably all the thought you ever gave it. As the title of a book it's a little cumbersome, a little intimidating, except that it's absolutely essential to the discussion of Secular Humanism as America's Established religion and how we can disestablish it.Follow the history of the founding of America and its degeneration into a secularist state. This secularism occurred in defiance of the greatest documentation in the world. The founding writings spelled out the dangers of Government-Church union. They also gave the simple preventive medicine for that historic poison. Christianity was the cure, and no, it wasn't a contradiction of the so-called ""separation principle "" that they supported biblical training and Christian conduct as essential to society's survival.Follow the trail back to the beginning of man's writings, to the Tower of Babel, then forward, to see the hand in hand relationship between men who would be gods and priests who would support and share the quest for ultimate power. All the eras of history, all the continents of the world echo the same message. Man cloaks secularism, the worship of himself, in religion. He demands protection, financial support, and unlimited power for his religion called Secular Humanism. He demands death or disgrace for all who oppose him.Secularists have hijacked words we once understood. Belief, faith, and trust are legal terms denoting tested and proven evidentiary facts. These words the secularists have redefined into mysticism and opinion, blindness and stupidity. Science is physical observation of the natural world. Secularists demand that Science belong only to them and encompasses presupposition, assumptions, and uniformitarianism or ""deep time. "" The Scriptures themselves prove their scientific nature and worth. More than a score of scientific facts prove that deep time is impossible. Over and over theories of pseudo-science have risen and fallen, refuted by true scientists.Secular Humanism has permeated government, the church and individuals in ways few fully realize or understand. People must understand it, and stop the progress before belief and freedom are things of the past in America. The Scriptures give many answers and we must heed them.The book includes multiple appendices and an exhaustive bibliography detailing the hundreds of sources researched to create this work. Founding documents, court cases, testimony from ancient Greece, India, Meso-America, Africa, and the works of respected scientists and historians all speak with one voice. Secularism, man's reason, and the marriage of government and church are deadly to man's survival.We believe this book is a necessary complement to the works of many conservative and faithful writers on the subject of why America is in such a decline, such a dangerous position to lose everything that matters.",639,2010,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355011634l/10585345.jpg,5,3.8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

My diaphragm seizes up and squeezes out a weird strangled whistle; my heart hammers like some psycho beat-box; and my stomach, it literally flies into the air, like a mad acrobat going for one of those crazy quadruple flips.Dark gold hair, rippling and springing in what must be twenty different shades, all in a riot and tumbling in what they call a bedroom tangle to her waist. Lazy, black, tilted eyes. Strawberry lips like little puffy marshmallows. But, oh, slightly parted. Indecent bitch.Stacked with twin Himalayan peaks, begging for fingers to scale them; gym toned arms that guarantee an energetic tussle in the sack; scarlet vampire nails that’ll scratch long and deep. A total sex-beast.She’s got an hourglass figure - the real deal - waist pinched in like somebody’s scraped out every ounce of fat, all trussed into the skimpiest black top and a leather mini skirt that just covers her scandalous little ass. Cheeks round as full moons hovering high in the air. Oh yeah, just lemme grab a handful of that.Her thighs and calves are athletic and taut, wrapped in skin that looks like shimmering caramel cream. Those legs, they don’t wanna stop, they shoot right up to those liquid velvet shoulders.And she’s got black spiked-heeled fuck-me sandals on those dainty fuck-me feet. The kind with fuck-me straps that bind up those fuck-me ankles.38 - 22 -36 inches of total come-on.Goddammit, this piece of ass has turned me into a poet.I’m like a magnifying glass, I hone in on every little detail, right down to the tiny round dots of blood red polish on her itsy-bitsy toenails. I pin my eyes on her as she slinks towards the building, like some kinda curvy snake writhing to the charmer’s flute. Tok, tok, tok, those stilettos hit the pavement. And yeah, yeah, yeah, those luscious hips sway.Something in my groin wakes up and wriggles like a worm. Wait a minute.

Being a golf fanatic, the analogies she uses make her books fun and sports-oriented, and in her latest guide, which promotes a healthy, competitive approach to achieving personal success, she tells you to visualize every shot and how you will play to win.What does success in life mean to you?How will you ultimately reach your goals?Is fear, procrastination, or negativity in self-talk and thought processes holding you back?Then Myers will take you to the driving range to encourage you to practice and work hard to develop your skills while making sure you are aligned correctly to hit your target. Teaching you how to cultivate a well-honed and resilient mindset, she will then show you how to devise a flexible, measurable, well-thought-out action plan that uses solid, action-oriented strategies to track your improvements.How you live your life is your choice, and if you find things aren’t working out, you can change midstream. There’s no need to adopt a stereotypical lifestyle or follow anyone’s example. The important thing is, what will work for you?Examine whether you are truly content and whether that contentment has enough substance to last you a lifetime. If not, embrace change, which could come in the form of opportunities. For example, in the workplace, your skills might also work well in other areas where you would feel more challenged or make quicker progress. Maybe you are drawn to a completely different profession such as journalism, law, teaching, or the performing arts, or you might be attracted to a sales and marketing position that would entail extensive travel.* * *About the bookAt the age of twenty, Lorii Myers had a near-death experience when an allergic reaction to food additives caused her throat to swell to a point where she could no longer catch her breath. As her husband checked her into emergency, she lost consciousness and it took a shot of adrenaline to bring her around.Weeks later, she still had blister-like welts on her face, and during a follow-up appointment, she asked her doctor what would have happened if she hadn’t made it to the hospital in time. He casually explained she could have slipped into a coma, but to Myers, the mother of a one-month-old baby, “It was the most significant thing in my world-survival,” she says. At that very point, her perspective changed. She focused on what was important to her, learning how to embrace urgency and use it to her advantage.Immediately caught in what she refers to as “the make-it-happen moment,” she launched a lifestyle that was geared toward the optimization of personal achievement. “One of my favorite mottos is ad astra per aspera,” she says, “Latin for ‘To the stars, through adversity.’”In her book, Make it Happen, the second in a series entitled 3 Off the Tee, she hopes to impart some of that spirit to her readers.Those who read her first book, Targeting Success, will already know Myers is a golf fanatic, and the golf analogies she uses in her books make them fun and sports-oriented. “I think constantly in terms of fairways and greens,” she says. “In other words, keep me on the straight and narrow and I can’t lose!”In any type of game, healthy competition prevails when you come out to play and play to win. A challenging game like golf requires mental and physical finesse and there is a constant incentive to improve your score, your abilities, and yourself. It reminds you of the value of being consistent, in control, and relentlessly resilient, and there is a powerful sense of urgency to stay focused, make decisions, and take your best shot. Despite inevitable distractions and hazards, as in life, you must keep your head in the game.“To be good at anything, you have to want it,” says Myers. There may be times when you hit a point of transition and lust after change. Whether the change is initiated by external forces or self-induced, she advises her readers to get set in motion and to make a lunge toward whatever is missing from their lives.Myers wrote Make it Happen to help you when what you see as achievable brushes your life, when you figure out that the status quo no longer cuts it, and when you combine desire, determination, and knowledge and decide it’s time to grab hold of your dreams and run with them. She wants you to be fully prepared to pull your dreams in from the fringe, get unstuck, feel the urgency, and step up.If you are confident that you have done the work, know what you want, and deserve that chance—why settle?Make It Happen promises a current, timely, and thought-provoking journey of self-discovery, and once you figure out what you want in life—expect nothing less.Stay the course!",304,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320360581l/13003367.jpg,97,4.19,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair,,['Stacey Koon'],9780895265074,['Nonfiction'],"For the first time, the entire story of the Rodney King affair is told in full detail - what happened and why, and the reasons the Simi Valley, California jury found the officers innocent on charges of using excessive force against a felony evader with a lengthening record of violent conduct. Sgt. Stacey C. Koon was the officer in charge on the night of March 3, 1991 when Rodney King led police on a 7.8 mile chase at speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. After stopping, King refused commands to submit to arrest and made threatening gestures toward the officers whose duty was to keep King from hurting himself, his two passengers, and other motorists. When LAPD officers physically tried to subdue him, he tossed four of them off his back. Then he absorbed two 50,000 volt stun-gun charges. All this happened before the now-infamous George Holliday videotape began. The first two seconds of the videotape - a part that most people have never seen - show King trying to assault another police officer. Yet for most Americans, that 82-second videotape - which was repeatedly edited to delete the portions showing Rodney King's violent behavior - is all they know about the events of March 3, 1991. It is a tragedy that resulted in the Los Angeles riots that left more than 50 people dead and some $800 million in property destroyed. Presumed Guilty is the truth. Not what was shown from an edited 82-second videotape and not what was reported each day by a media that consciously ignored certain facts and reported other facts to mold the public mind toward a verdict of guilt. Sgt. Koon's account of the night of March 3, 1991 and the days leading up to and including the trial tells about how four dedicatedpolice officers were betrayed by the superiors they served. It also tells how the leaders of the Los Angeles Police Department and the city establishment have scurried to cover their own culpability in creating the policies that made the Rodney King affair an inevitable tragedy.",263,1992,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387705148l/989026.jpg,39,3.46,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Amazing Grief A Healing Guide for Parents of Young Addicts,,['Charles Harper'],,[],"Amazing Grief: A Healing Guide for Parents of Young Addicts, is a hands-on, interactive guide that represents 30 years of working closely with addicted young people in crisis. As the title suggests, the 300-page book offers a powerful and hopeful refuge for parents who often have few answers for their agony outside of conventional and often very expensive treatment programs.Rev. Charlie Harper began his career working with teenagers in crisis and their parents as the house manager and resident counselor at a home for single teenage mothers and street gangs in Pomona, California. He received his BA in Psychology from Pitzer College and his Master of Divinity from Yale Divinity School.He spent eight years in church ministry focusing on youth ministry. For the past 10 years Rev. Harper has served as a street minister to families and young people in crisis.Rev. Harper is a father of two and a stepfather to four. Over the past 10 years, inaddition to attending to his own recovery from alcoholism, public speaking engagements, and a teacher of drama and art, he has served over 200 families in crisis.His experience as a church pastor, spiritual director, faith counselor and life coach coalesced into a unique perspective and practice of recovery, and particularly, the lack of care and concern for the parents of young people in crisis.Through his experience, faith and education Harper has taken his extraordinary life experience of working with young people and their parents… and put them together between the covers of Amazing Grief: A Healing Guide for Parents of Young Addicts.The book is based on three life saving observations:1. When parents took care of themselves during a crisis, their child was twice as likely to recover their life.2. Unlike the death of a loved one, the stages of grief for a parent of a child in crisis has a far more complicated grief process, including 11 stages of grief compared to the commonly accepted 6 stages of grief.3. Most remarkably, he found that when parents applied the principles of his stages of grief and their antidotes, they were empowered to heal and became an empowering force for their child’s recovery while growing spiritually and emotionally themselves.Harper offers his well-articulated “11 Stages of Grief” to help parents cope with the loss of innocence of their children and the overwhelming guilt and shame they often feel after the shock of discovering that their son or daughter is an addict.For each stage of grief, Harper presents a composite portrait of a fictitious family based on his direct experience with addicted teens and their parents. Universal themes of addiction and recovery are revealed in the raw, in-your-face drama and wreckage wrought by addiction.Then a transformative antidote to each stage of grief is presented as a virtue—anger has its antidote in forbearance, denial has its antidote in honesty. This helps parents find inner strength as they creatively process their grief. Powerful exercises, meditations and prayers accompany a discussion of each stage of grief to assist families on their journey. The meditations and prayers are also available as free downloads onwww.amazinggrief.com.Amazing Grief: A Healing Guide for Parents of Young Addicts, has recently won a “Best Books 2011” Award from USA Book News.

Quinn uses her knowledge of Andean and Amazon plant medicine, ceremony, and the geography of Peru to tell a very fast paced story full of action and suspense.Tumultuous seas caused by a nuclear holocaust, throw a group of survivors into a large tunnel system under the Andean mountains of Peru. They settle into a large cavern which is the first of many strange ‘coincidences’ that enable them to survive many years in the cavern safe from outside contamination.Knowing that ignorance and intolerance led to the virtual demise of humanity, the group decide to teach the future generation differently. Their plan: to raise their children in an environment of peace and love, devoid of the hate and aggression that plagued humans for so long.They emerge from the cavern many generations later with Tsulib, a tribe elder as their guide who continues the group’s goal of changing the way future generations think by keeping the destructive history of humans secret from the younger tribe members. This decision will be challenged with a very cruel lesson that will put the whole tribe in jeopardy. They must choose to be forever on the run or revert to past aggressive ways to survive.One of the main characters in Quinn’s story is a young woman named Kettiajya who is an outsider; a sole nomad who sacrifices her idyllic life for love and pays with unbelievable sorrows. The Misha is a tribe of mystical women whose DNA was altered by nuclear contamination which gave them power to use the energies of nature. Dilahn is a child with a very challenging destiny.Quinn’s work may appear as aiming for the jugular as she hypothesizes about the future of the planet and its inhabitants.

Heart’s Blood is a riveting family saga set on the border of southern Arizona. The story follows the life of the central character, Tyler McNeil, from his impulsive (and fateful) decision to leave his itinerant existence, through unexpected parenthood, loss, love, and finally peace in his old age.A cast of colorful characters wander in and out of the tale, sometimes taking center stage, sometimes weaving themselves into the tapestry of the whole. We meet Mana, an illiterate and abused border crosser who bears a child and then vanishes; Lita, her infant daughter whom Ty adopts and raises; the complex and evil Blanco, leader of a powerful drug cartel; the frightening Marcela Beltran, Blanco’s wife, who only eats white food and covets Lita’s daughter; Claire, the love of Ty’s life whose stumbling heart threatens to take her from him; and, CJ, Ty’s natural son who rejects him when he learns of his parenthood. These and many others serve up a hearty mixture of love, hate, murder, compassion, and humor.On one important level, Heart’s Blood is a novel of place, filled with lyrical and cinematic descriptions of the vistas of southern Arizona, the changing seasons, and the rich mix of rural life at the end of the 20th century. On another level it brims with those themes that scream at us daily from the media -- the evils of the drug trade, illegal immigration, human smuggling, and the plight of those caught up in the drama of life on both sides of the border.

Lovesick: a novelistic memoir,,['Isobel Blackthorn'],9780987176,[],"A wild adventure through Thatcher’s Britain, set against a backdrop of the British Indie Music Scene. Naïve, defiant and incisively witty, Isobel Blackthorn fashions her own path through the counter-culture, poverty and politics of the eighties. By turn absurdly funny, sexually charged an heartrendingly sad, Lovesick is an unforgettable, tragi-comic tale of a young woman’s search for her identity.Pretty girl, nice smile is all Isobel can say about herself. That, and she’s working class. What matters to her is she’s different. After devouring Camus’ The Outsider she realises for reasons strange to her, she is strange to the world. And she’s searching for love. It’s a disastrous mix. Her unquenchable need for romance leads her to Lanzarote, Canary Islands, were she takes unconventionality to extremes. She’d determined to be truly herself, face her fears and go with the flow. But her obsession with the charismatic Miguel, her thirst for danger and an acquired taste for cocaine launch her into the island’s criminal underworld.""Seen through the eyes of a woman of heart and mind, this is a story that takes the reader on a tempestuous journey through the music and politics, the frenzies and phobias of Thatcher’s England in the 1980s. The passions of the era are enacted in Isobel Blackthorn’s headlong pursuit of love and sexual fulfilment, leading her eventually to the fabled beauty of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, a type of anti-England. The hedonism Isobel ‘adopts’ on Lanzarote as a corrective to the bleak outcomes of her political commitment and her quest for love take in, unavailingly, free-wheeling experiments with a smorgasbord of drugs. What shines through in these pages is Isobel Blackthorn’s determination, despite setbacks and episodes of despair, to engage with life truthfully.

Brotherton's writing far exceeds that of standard vampire fare...""-Kirkus ReviewsIn the small town of Keating, Iowa, the surname Daniels is synonymous with insanity. Recently dumped by his girlfriend and fired from his job, Merton Daniels has been reduced to crashing on a friend's couch and visiting a blood center to exchange his plasma for cash. Awakened from an unintentional drunken stupor by a voice in his head calling his name, Merton finds a mysterious card tucked under his arm. A subsequent meeting with a beleaguered bureaucrat sets Merton, along with his chattering roommate, Coaler, on an unsupervised apprenticeship in the finer points of reclaiming the dead: slaying vampires.While Merton combats delusions and an inner voice that hounds him with a relentlessness that exceeds even that of his undead adversaries, the novel tracks a thought-provoking mythology of the undead in Judas Iscariot, a shape-shifting and blood-thirsty creature who was reborn when the boundary between life and death was still convulsing.Resonant with existential echoes of Sartre and Salinger, and a singular sense of humor that recalls Vonnegut and Palahniuk, Reclaiming the Dead is an infectious and inventive tale that stands the vampire fantasy genre on its ear with a literate and sophisticated story of modern life and redemption.""Anyone who fights with monsters should take care that he does not in the process become a monster.

The same morning--the first of a new Muslim century--hundreds of gunmen stunned the world by seizing Islam's holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Armed with rifles that they had smuggled inside coffins, these men came from more than a dozen countries, launching the first operation of global jihad in modern times. Led by a Saudi preacher named Juhayman al Uteybi, they believed that the Saudi royal family had become a craven servant of American infidels, and sought a return to the glory of uncompromising Islam. With nearly 100,000 worshippers trapped inside the holy compound, Mecca's bloody siege lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths.Despite U.S. assistance, the Saudi royal family proved haplessly incapable of dislodging the occupier, whose ranks included American converts to Islam. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini blamed the Great Satan--the United States --for defiling the shrine, prompting mobs to storm and torch American embassies in Pakistan and Libya. The desperate Saudis finally enlisted the help of French commandos led by tough-as-nails Captain Paul Barril, who prepared the final assault and supplied poison gas that knocked out the insurgents. Though most captured gunmen were quickly beheaded, the Saudi royal family responded to this unprecedented challenge by compromising with the rebels' supporters among the kingdom's most senior clerics, helping them nurture and export Juhayman's violent brand of Islam around the world.This dramatic and immensely consequential story was barely covered in the press in the pre-CNN, pre-Al Jazeera days, as Saudi Arabia imposed an information blackout and kept foreign correspondents away. Yaroslav Trofimov now penetrates this veil of silence, interviewing for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, including former terrorists, and drawing on hundreds of documents that had been declassified on his request. Written with the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, ""The Siege of Mecca"" reveals how Saudi reaction to the uprising in Mecca set free the forces that produced the attacks of 9/11, and the harrowing circumstances that surround us today.",301,2007,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440547776l/320657._SY475_.jpg,"2,120",4.18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Above him, the Red Army was encircling Berlin as his dream of a thousand-year Aryan empire lay in ruins. Hitler placed a glass cyanide capsule between his teeth and pointed a loaded service pistol at his right temple. Then, smugly believing he had both evaded capture and escaped all accountability for his crimes, he bit down and pulled the trigger. He was wrong! The Last Way Station begins moments after Hitler's successful suicide, when the F�hrer finds himself mysteriously transported to a numbingly cold, solitary holding cell in the afterworld. There, he meets his caseworker, a supernatural being tasked with helping him face, and work through, his sins.

One Voice Raised: A Triumph Over Rape,,"['Jennifer A. Wheatley-Wolf', 'Sherry Audette Morrow', 'David H. Cordle Sr.']",9780615562476,[],"2013 ELit Bronze Medal Winner-True Crime One Voice Raised: A Triumph Over Rape At 3:15 am on the morning of August 21, 1988, an unknown assailant climbed onto the 2nd floor balcony of my home and entered through a sliding glass door. He crept through the house and down the stairs. He entered my ground floor bedroom and hid in the shadows. When I came into my bedroom from the bathroom, he grabbed me and locked me in a bear-hug. I felt something being wound tightly around my neck and something was being stuffed into my mouth. I couldn't breathe. I never saw the face of the man who assaulted and raped me that night. I never believed he would be caught. I spent 20 years wondering who he was, how many other women he had raped and when he would strike again. If not for the dogged determination of Chief Investigator David Cordle, of Anne Arundel County, in Annapolis, Md, my case would never have been solved. With the help of a grant from the government to re-test cold case evidence and the advances of forensic science, a suspect was found and arrested in November of 2009. Beginning in 2010, after my case went to trial, Dave Cordle and I began sharing this story in the book we wrote- One Voice Raised, A Triumph Over Rape. We have been invited to speak at many conferences, schools, police departments and awareness organizations in the United States and Canada. My message is one of hope; hope for survivors and their families to believe in their strength and the goodness of others. There is no doubt that being raped changed my life. Having my case solved and finally seeing the face of my attacker in the courtroom was extremely empowering for me. Hearing the ""Guilty"" verdicts on January 13, 2010 helped me to realize I am much stronger than I give myself credit for. In our presentations, I speak about my experience as a rape victim and the years of rebuilding my life and how I found a way to make the passage from thinking of myself as a victim of rape to calling myself a survivor. Dave Cordle illuminates the process of assembling the puzzle pieces that led to the arrest and prosecution of one of his longest open cases. ------------------------------------------- Since publication of One Voice Raised, 2 more victims have been linked through DNA to serial rapist, William Joseph Trice. *May 31, 1987 in Montgomery County, Maryland. *August, 1988 in Silver Springs, Maryland ""It brings peace of mind to Trice's victims to know their attacker has been caught and convicted.

No one else is around and you need to get to a life-and-death family emergency of your own before it is too late. What would you do?

My name is Dave, and this is my very first collection of essays. As you can probably imagine, it pretty much has everything. In fact, if you like stories about stolen meat, animal attacks, young love, death, naked people, clergymen, rock 'n' roll, irritable Canadians, and prison, you have just hit a street called Easy because my book talks about all that stuff and a bunch of other stuff, too.Getting back to that prison thing for a second—I can think of almost no better place to read my book than from within the confines of a correctional facility. For starters, you will definitely have the time. Also, cozying up with a good book in front of your fellow inmates is a great way to show them a softer side that for some reason no one ever wants to hear about in the yard.Fear not, though, non-convicts, my book makes for a solid read outside of prison, too. At the beach, on the subway, while whitewater rafting, during couples counseling, under local anesthesia—I have personally seen to it that my book is totally readable in all these scenarios, as well as in most other scenarios out there today. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think so much that you will forget all your problems while simultaneously creating a few new ones. In limited instances it has been known to cause severe dehydration and the occasional groin pull, but honestly I don't know what that's about. That said, it's probably not a bad idea to keep a glass of water handy and really stretch things out before strapping yourself in for a literary thrill ride you will want to experience again and again until you are either dead or your eyesight fails completely, whichever comes first.

An Impossible Dream Story,,['J.V. Petretta'],9781457506802,[],"He learned early on that life without a dream is not worth living, so Vinny dreamed big time, striving to live his life to the fullest. Pursuing that dream would take him on a raging whirlpool of life, slamming him often to the extreme outward fringes to be bashed and broken, only to be sucked back for more. You will follow his adventures from the humble beginnings of a three-room school house, to surviving childhood abuse, to tuberculosis, and through the perils of war—to become a leader and successful business and family man. You will meet the many loves of his life, one of which is peddling his bicycle to anywhere his mind and tired legs will take him. Then, you will witness his self-destruction, his fall to that lowly humble place called grace—to a point where there was nothing left but an impossible dream. All he wanted was to be somebody’s hero.~This is An Impossible Dream Story, a work of fiction, songs, and poems inspired by many true events in my life. All portions of this story have been fictionalized, some to enhance understanding, some to lessen my own embarrassment, a few embellished to dramatize situations and a couple came out of thin air. As was true with the story line, so is it with characters, companies, and companions. Some public identities were fictitiously used in a clearly historical context.

Then, in a broad sweep, the book moves forward to consider not the battles and treaties of kings and prime ministers, emperors and generals, but the most important ideas we have evolved, by which we live and which separate us from other animals. Watson explores the first languages and the first words, the birth of the gods, the origins of art, the profound intellectual consequences of money. He describes the invention of writing, early ideas about law, why sacrifice and the soul have proved so enduring in religion. He explains how ideas about time evolved, how numbers were conceived, how science, medicine, sociology, economics, and capitalism came into being. He shows how the discovery of the New World changed forever the way that we think, and why Chinese creativity faded after the Middle Ages.In the course of this commanding narrative, Watson reveals the linkages down the ages in the ideas of many apparently disparate philosophers, astronomers, religious leaders, biologists, inventors, poets, jurists, and scores of others.

The real challenge: optimizing one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the world — abortion.Founding Partner, Roman Citrano, a successful entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, soon struggles with what he believes is his choice to establish the controversial new company. He soon realizes that he and others are but pawns on a massive, ugly chessboard being manipulated to benefit a far larger, illicit market in human organs for transplantation. Unknowingly, prime, hyper-enriched organs are spawned from the aborted fetuses and grown like hydroponic vegetables.An unfolding world of deceit, rape, human trafficking and assassination becomes deeply personal as Roman's sole love interest secretly uses one of his new abortion services to terminate her untimely pregnancy. When she disappears, his frantic search becomes a hellish nightmare that grows worse by the hour.Based on true events, this bold novel involves some of the world's oldest, most emotional and controversial issues.

As she begins to repair her mind we meet her therapist, counselors and friends in recovery. Jill's mother plays an important roll by keeping things light with her humor and naivety.

Jill is back in business, seeing her doctors and resuming her medications. Therapy and counseling are helping her see there is a way out of her challenging circumstances if she can just hold on and trust the help that is being provided to her by friends and professionals.

She was up long before the sun to begin her farm work, as usual. But this would be no ordinary day, this second Friday of the new year. This was the day Leonida and a group of smallholder farmers in western Kenya would begin their exodus, as she said, “from misery to Canaan,” the land of milk and honey.Africa’s smallholder farmers, most of whom are women, know misery. They toil in a time warp, living and working essentially as their forebears did a century ago. With tired seeds, meager soil nutrition, primitive storage facilities, wretched roads, and no capital or credit, they harvest less than one-quarter the yields of Western farmers. The romantic ideal of African farmers––rural villagers in touch with nature, tending bucolic fields––is in reality a horror scene of malnourished children, backbreaking manual work, and profound hopelessness. Growing food is their driving preoccupation, and still they don’t have enough to feed their families throughout the year. The wanjala––the annual hunger season that can stretch from one month to as many as eight or nine––abides.But in January 2011, Leonida and her neighbors came together and took the enormous risk of trying to change their lives. Award-winning author and world hunger activist Roger Thurow spent a year with four of them––Leonida Wanyama, Rasoa Wasike, Francis Mamati, and Zipporah Biketi––to intimately chronicle their efforts. In The Last Hunger Season, he illuminates the profound challenges these farmers and their families face, and follows them through the seasons to see whether, with a little bit of help from a new social enterprise organization called One Acre Fund, they might transcend lives of dire poverty and hunger.The daily dramas of the farmers’ lives unfold against the backdrop of a looming global challenge: to feed a growing population, world food production must nearly double by 2050.

It was meant to send a shudder down the spines of the nation's most incorrigible criminals. It stripped Al Capone of his power. It tamed ""Machine Gun"" Kelly into a model of decorum. It took the birds away from the Birdman of Alcatraz.When prisoners boarded the boat for Alcatraz, they knew that they had reached the end of the line. Not only was this the toughest of all Federal penitentiaries, but it was also said to be virtually escape-proof. The island was a natural fortress, separated from the mainland by a narrow strait of freezing water and deadly currents. This prison was the U.S. government's drastic answer to the lawlessness unleashed under Prohibition, which continued throughout the ""Roaring Twenties"" and into the teeth of the Great Depression. Alcatraz, with its damp cold and austere isolation, its rigid discipline and strict rule of silence, was as tough as the criminals that were sent there, and by the time the prison closed down in 1963, ""the Rock"" had indisputably done its job.Alcatraz - A History of the Penitentiary Years has sustained as a staple reference for staff members on Alcatraz and remains one of the most comprehensive references chronicling the history. This mammoth reference navigates the island's history through rarely seen documents, interviews and hundreds of pages of historic photographs. Author interviews range from men such as legendary FBI fugitive James ""Whitey' Bulger; Dale Stamphill, a principle in the 1938 escape with Doc Barker and Henry Young; to Atom Spy Morton Sobell, the codefendant of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.Michael Esslinger thoroughly details the prominent events, inmates, and life inside the most infamous prison in American History. His research included hundreds of hours examining actual Alcatraz inmate case files (including rare original documents from Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, and over a hundred others) exploring the prison grounds from the rooftop to the waterfront to help retrace events, escape routes, in addition to conducting various interviews with former inmates & guards. Esslinger interviewed a variety of principle figures, comprised of both convicts and officers who were either involved, on-duty, or on Alcatraz during nearly escape attempt. Interviews included prisoners and officers that covered each era of operations at Alcatraz from the early military period in the late 1920's, through the federal years, 1934 to 1963.His study has resulted in detailed accounts of all the recorded escape attempts including the Battle of Alcatraz. A detailed account of the 1962 escape of Frank Morris and the Anglin Brothers provides rare insight extracted through photos, and over 1,700 pages of FBI and Bureau of Prisons investigative notes.Detailed narratives of Alcatraz's most notable inmates who include Robert Stroud (Birdman of Alcatraz), Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, Frank Morris, the Anglin Brothers, Doc Barker, Joe Cretzer, Bernard Coy, Miran Thompson, Sam Shockley, and many-many others.

I've always wanted to write one but until now have been afraid to do so. The reason is simple enough: most men in my experience have very little idea of what really goes on in a woman's heart or head. Now, at the age of 74, I just might know enough and have sufficient courage to write on the subject - the way of a man with a woman, of a woman with a man.My story is set in the Pacific, although not in the paradise we've always been led to believe exists there. It is 1942 in Java and the Japanese are invading the islands like a swarm of locusts.I have tried to capture the essence of love - how in a world gone mad with malice and hate, it has the ability to forgive and to heal. As it is in this story, love is always hard earned but, in the end, a most wonderful and necessary emotion.

The book reveals extraordinary tales of passionate Chefs as they compete in the Medallion d’Oro, crowning the greatest cuisinier in America.High spirited, intelligent and spicy, this is the delicious story of Pacomino Oakley always called Paco. Leading an unbridled lifestyle among the rich and famous, he stumbled into a plot that exposed his true identity, all while uncovering his artistic talents and following a path to solve the puzzle of his mysterious first love.Born into a family of noted stonemasons and artisans imported from Italy for their remarkable skills, he grew up watching the creation of multi-million dollar estates, sitting like castles on the verdant soft summits of Santa Barbara and Montecito, California in the 1920's.The boy had an inauspicious birth secreted away in the beginning since his rolling stone of a father evaporated upon knowledge of his coming. Paco was the only thing that made his Mother’s beautiful mahogany-colored eyes sparkle with joy. She sang to him in Italian, fed him tenderly from her large perfect breasts and made him darling baby dresses of vintage lace with satin bows. She taught him to dance and to paint on a big white china platter in strawberry jam with his tiny fingers.Given all this loving attention Paco’s eyes sparkled too, just like hers, with an adorable little crinkle at the outside corners that gave the impression he was always smiling. His soft brown curls matched his eyes and sprang out in ringlets that his Mother made perfect by wrapping strands around her fingers.The boy grew to a man, still painting, only now with fine sable brushes, with the same crinkly laughing eyes but the curls were carefully oiled to lay stark and flat with a part down the center according to the current fashion. He moved with a graceful agile gait, athletic and suntanned, a bearing unique to California. While he worked he wore a handsome uniform of dark blue lightweight serge with small brass buttons and epaulets. Paco’s trousers were slim tan jodhpurs and he was finished with a pair of dutifully polished sable knee high boots. He put on a fresh white shirt each day and an Eaton tie peeked out of his collar.A breed of super wealthy Americans, called “The Hill Barons”, were Paco’s patrons, the ones, Diehls, the foremost gourmet market in the region, handled with kid gloves. Earnestly searching the globe for their requests, Paco supplied the fabulous kitchens where all was converted to luxurious dining, extravagant parties and exquisite events.At 6:00am each morning Paco always stocked a fine highly polished black truck displaying the famous Diehls trademark in gold script on the side. The world's best fresh food and culinary delicacies were fulfilled, following the orders of a wild, eccentric and often hilarious assortment of Chefs and cooks.Follow the fireworks aboard an infamous gambling ship and experience the opening of Santa Barbara's prized Biltmore Hotel. Be entertained by the steady stream of notables, from Lindbergh and Chaplin to sexy starlets of the silver screen who flood the Santa Barbara social scene with excitement, celebrity and scandal.An ardent lover of the richness and artistry before him, Paco dreams of studying in the Academy del Arte of Florence as he sees his complex world explode with intrigue, sensual pleasures and tangled relationships.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?InHow the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins' research project—more than four years in duration—uncovered five step-wise stages of decline:Stage 1: Hubris Born of SuccessStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of MoreStage 3: Denial of Risk and PerilStage 4: Grasping for SalvationStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or DeathBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.Great companies can stumble, badly, and recover.Every institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins' research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover—in some cases, coming back even stronger—even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.Decline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains.

He firmly believes that while our earnings show how we make a living, our contributions to the society show how we make a life. A little about what this book is all about - For me, life had always been a game of choices. It is a game of perceptions that we draw everyday within our minds and their associated outlook. To some, life has always been ""half-full"" while to others; it has been ""half-empty."" Through this book, I can guarantee that one can easily solder wire the brain to look only for the ""half-full"" side that our life has to offer. It is not a book of DOs and DONTs, neither it is some kind of a rulebook nor does it unveil the secret recipe of ""that"" magic potion we had been searching for years. The book, in reality, is a beautiful compilation of my personal and professional experiences and describes the various teachings that Life offered to me during all these years. I was always taught that to become wise, you have to make decisions in the form of choices. If your choice is good, it will help you climb a step ahead on the life ladder. But if it backfires, then a unique opportunity is offered to un-learn and re-learn it in such a manner that makes you successful on its next application. Life is not only stranger than we can imagine, it is more mysterious; one which is like a riddle wrapped in an enigma. Life is also the single-most complex phenomenon to understand after the human brain.

The Deeper Wound,,['Deepak Chopra'],9781400045051,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Health', 'Religion', 'Psychology']","The author ofHow to Know Godprovides help for healing deep trauma—whenever it arises—so we may find peace in ourselves and in our world.Terror came from the sky, and afterward the world would never be the same. September, 11, 2001, defined tragedy for a generation. On that day Deepak Chopra found himself driving from city to city, meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering. In response he has writtenThe Deeper Wound, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished.The opening section, “In the Face of Tragedy,” defines suffering as the pain that threatens to make life meaningless. When our deepest needs go unfulfilled, suffering begins. We begin to heal when we go beyond personal anger and fear to a realization of our true self, the self that was never afraid and can never be wounded.The true self contains the light that no darkness can attack. Having described a path of awareness and compassion that leads to the light, the second half ofThe Deeper Woundtakes us there through “A Hundred Days of Healing,” daily affirmations, exercises, insights, lessons, and questions—each a step out of pain toward a higher reality. “We can become living memorials to tragedy by restoring the power of life,” writes Deepak Chopra. “You are that life, you are that power. Let us see if we can find the spark that will make the spiritual flame spring up.”Healing yourself comes in two stages—first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul’s energy. It is a gentle and fragile path, very much like holding on to a thread as it leads you from step to step.If you take the time to listen to the voice of silence, you will be astonished at the power you have at your command, however long that power has been overlooked.A portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher from the sale of this book will be donated to the Red Cross to aid in humanitarian relief efforts around the world.",0,2001,,,235,3.7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

I knew it on that very first day when my newly adopted son stretched out his fingers in front of him, in the cold Moscow air, to show me that he had no gloves on his hands and I realized I had left his brand new gloves on the plane. We watched together as the plane taxied down the runway, leaving with his new gloves still aboard. He looked at me with disappointment, reached for the packet of adoption papers that I carried under my arm and wordlessly took it from me. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he knew it was important and that, clearly, I was too careless to be trusted with it. From then on, he insisted on carrying the packet himself.

Even though he runs back into the hills as quickly as he arrives, she's determined to find out who he is because something about the young boy haunts her. What would make him desperate enough to steal and eat from her garden? But what she can't imagine is what the boy faces, each day and night, in the filthy lean-to hut miles up in the hills. Who is he? How did he come to live in the hills? Where did he come from? And, more importantly, can she save him?

That night, in the few minutes it takes to play a hard-rock standard, the fate of many of the unsuspecting nightclub patrons was determined with awful certainty. The blaze was ignited when pyrotechnics set off by Great White, a 1980s heavy-metal band, lit flammable polyurethane ""egg crate"" foam sound insulation on the club's walls.

"Success, Money and You: Everybody knows how to become a millionaire",,['Fred Schäfer'],,"['Economics', 'Finance']","Start your journey to financial success!This is a concise and inspiring must-read book for people who seek secure and lasting achievements: in business, professionally and financially. You will discover the philosophy of the rich, the philosophy of the poor and powerful success strategies. You will learn how to re-program your thinking and how to overcome money-making limitations. Just as you can be a good mechanic, a good accountant, a good shop assistant or whatever you are, you can be financially very successful.Extract:You Need To Acquire A Philosophy: There is a philosophy of the rich and a philosophy of the poor. I very deliberately did not say ""you need to acquire a money making philosophy"" – although this is indeed what you need. But that's not all. You need more. You need a money making philosophy in order to create wealth, there is no question about that. However, at this point you also have to ask yourself: what is it all about? How is it going to contribute to a life well lived? What is a life well lived? Your money making philosophy has to be compatible with whatever else is important in your life – your relationships, your sense of integrity, your spiritual beliefs, your social life, your recreational needs and so on. In other words, you need to create a philosophy of your life that supports your money making ambitions in a way that is not in conflict with your fundamental values and beliefs of what your life well lived is really all about. If there is a conflict, it will work against you – the emotions resulting from this conflict will consciously and subconsciously have a negative impact on both your money making potential and your ability to enjoy life. It is very important that you get your whole life under control, that you develop a philosophy that supports not only your money making ambitions but your entire existence.James Rohn once told me: ""There is a philosophy of the rich and a philosophy of the poor"".Rich people ...",126,2008,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349484772l/16069499.jpg,15,4.2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

"AM I STILL AUTISTIC? How a Low-Functioning, Slightly Retarded Toddler Became CEO of a Multi-Million Dollar National Corporation",,['John Hall'],0615504663,[],"Imagine you are in the kind of calm, tranquil, altered-consciousness state people aspire to when they meditate.Imagine you feel no tension or stress whatsoever, neither in mind, body, or spirit. Your entire psyche is enveloped in peace and comfort.Nothing bothers you.Outside noises are meaningless. Time is meaningless. You move through life with complete serenity, utterly unperturbed by whatever beings and sounds exist around you.Here is the good news: if your son or daughter is autistic, that is where they live, in that beautiful, peaceful, totally comfortable world. Nothing bothers them; nothing causes them pain or disrupts their contentment—until you or someone else intrudes on their private space.John Hall's son lives there. Even when John's son is pushed or pulled out of his altered state of consciousness, he avoids connecting with his father, his mother, his sister, and everyone else. Unless someone interacts with him in his face every moment, John's son retreats into his private world where he is perfectly happy, completely safe, and thoroughly comfortable.His father and the book's author, John Hall knows exactly how he feels.He used to live there, too.In Am I Still Autistic?: How a Low-Functioning, Slightly Retarded Toddler Became CEO of a Multi-Million Dollar National Corporation, John chronicles how he overcame autism, what it was like, the pain of moving from his autistic state to the mainstream world, things he had to learn that most people take for granted, and what he was able to accomplish against all odds. John was able to eventually make friends, graduate from high school, put himself through college, earn his MBA, start a successful company, and start a family!Overcoming autism was only part of his battle though. John writes about how many of his most significant life challenges began after he began to emerge from his autistic shell - some which lingered long into John's adult life, despite his many successes.But when John's own son was diagnosed with autism in 2007, John's life was shattered. He will never forget how he sobbed as his son's neurologist handed down his son's diagnosis. At that moment, John experienced the same sense of hopelessness that most parents do when they receive such a diagnosis. And there was so much more. He immediately thought of the hurt, pain, loneliness he experienced growing up, how hard it was to learn how to look at people and to communicate with them, how scary it all was, and how the entire experience follows him to this day. John was heart-broken that his son would be relegated to have the same experiences.For years, John could hardly say the word autistic when talking about my son. He was not ashamed of his beautiful boy in anyway. John just couldn't hear himself say the word, ""autistic"" in the same sentence as his little boy's name. John was in denial. Writing this book has allowed him to face his son's diagnosis head on and has restored his hope.With this book, John hopes to provide inspiration to so many others who have been affected by autism - parents, educators, therapists, and loved ones of those with autism. Autism does not have to be a life sentence. Love, persistence, and support make all the difference in the world. It is why John is who he is today and why he knows his son will be able to write a book about how he overcame autism one day!As science seeks to develop a “cure” for autism, John seeks to expand autism awareness and hope. Rather than highlighting autism symptoms and treatment options, John's book puts a human face on the disorder. Am I Still Autistic? provides a unique perspective on autism – told by someone who has experienced it firsthand.Whether you are a parent of an autistic or special-needs child, a teacher, therapist, or family member, this book will provide fresh context on what it is like to be autistic and how anything is possible. Even if you are not affected by autism, this book will move and inspire you!",0,2011,,,20,3.95,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

The 13th Apostle,,['Raina C. Smith'],9781463558642,[],"Father Joseph is a devout priest with a sad but inspirational backstory living in Rome when he stumbles upon a well guarded ancient scroll shrouded in secrecy at the Vatican. It was written, he learns, over two thousand years ago by a man believed by a select few to have been a mysterious thirteenth apostle of Christ. When the disturbing prophecies of the scroll are revealed to Father Joseph he is certain the end of days for man is here and he is compelled to embark upon a journey around the world on a quest to save the soul of mankind. He is unaware that Glenn, an angel from the highest order of heaven, has already descended to earth to determine whether man has finally and completely emptied his soul of purity of heart of his own free will. If so, man's demise is imminent. Glenn's work is interrupted when the underworld sends Falene to place a well thought out, diabolical wager with the angel; find the last soul on earth with the purest of heart then turn him or her over to her to be tested. In no other way could the true resolve of mankind be measured. Glenn accepts the bet. If he loses, then all of humanity will be turned over to hell, the abode of the devils where the wicked dwell. When the chosen one is selected as the ultimate representative for all and stripped to his or her core and put to tests a hero would beg to be spared, can he or she rise up against evil in it's most intimidating form to prove that goodness still exists within the heart of mankind? The 13th Apostle begs readers to consider whether mankind is inherently good or evil and where they fall along that often very fine line.

Dying in Indian Country: A Family Journey from Self-Destruction to Opposing Tribal Sovereignty,,"['Beth  Ward', 'Elizabeth  Morris']",9781449737924,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Cultural', 'Native American History']","Wilson grew up watching members of his family die of alcoholism, child abuse, suicide, and violence. Like many others, he blamed all the problems on ""white people.""Beth Ward grew up in a middle-class home in the suburbs. Raised in a politically left family, she also believed that all problems on the reservation originated with cruel treatment by settlers and the stealing of land. Meeting Wilson, her first close experience with a tribal member, she stepped out of the comfort of suburban life into a whole new, frightening world.After almost ten years of living with Wilson's alcoholism and the terrible dangers that came with it, they both came to realize that individual behavior and personal decisions were at the root of a man's troubles, including their own. Further, corrupt tribal government, dishonest federal Indian policy, and the controlling reservation system had more to do with the current despair in his community than what had happened 150 years ago.Here is the plain truth in the eyes of one family, in the hope that at least some of the dying-physical, emotional, and spiritual-may be recognized and prevented.What cannot be denied is that a large number of Native Americans are dying from alcoholism, drug abuse, suicide, and violence. Popular belief is that the white culture and its past sins are to blame. However, tribal government as it behaves today, coupled with current federal Indian policy, may have more to do with the present condition.Unfortunately, persistent public misconceptions about Indian Country, misconceptions sometimes promoted by tribal government and others enjoying unaudited money and power, have worked to keep the situation just as it is.",502,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355057716l/15873220.jpg,47,3.79,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Five years later, he is released from a psychiatric facility and his circle of friends overlap with those of Hannah, the girl he maimed. He finds himself drawn to her, sadistically at first, but after Jared, an acquaintance from the hospital, covets her for his own disturbing uses, Matt struggles to protect her. Hannah's an outcast, not only because of the scars Matt gave her, but because of the ones she's given herself, too. Matt's heroin addiction and the way he exploits her body harm her in places sharp objects can't touch. Fearful that a dark secret will be disclosed, and with his addiction to heroin worsening, Matt chooses to abandon Hannah, allowing her to fall prey to Jared. Jared is a sociopath obsessed with a fantasy that Hannah can fly...a theory he plans on forcing her to test, even if the cost is her life. Vein Fire gives a startling portrait of Hannah, a young woman with Borderline Personality Disorder. This dark, voyeuristic story exposes the dysfunction she surrounds herself with as a method of self-harm.

Today, “religious others” often live next door. At a changing time when one public prayer spoken during the 2009 U.S. presidential inauguration festivities was addressed to “O god of our many understandings,” the evangelical Christian church should do more than simply dismiss non-Christian religions as pagan without argument or comment. The Church needs a theology of religions that is Christ-honoring, biblically faithful, intellectually satisfying, compassionate, and that will encourage Spirit-powered mission.Oregon-based theology professor Todd Miles writes to that end inA God of Many Understandings?, attempting, as the scholar Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen puts it, “to think theologically about what it means for Christians to live with people of other faiths and about the relationship of Christianity to other religions.”",416,2010,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328815478l/7562559.jpg,44,4.2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

His allies include homeless children, bag ladies, certain tribes on the Molecular level, an ancient samurai sword, post-apocalyptic trashcan gladiators, an artist and part-time witch, a cook. His adversary is a corporation of elite players in media, military, government and industry bent on building a secret, high-risk--and highly profitable--hot fusion power plant in lower Manhattan.

This young Jewish couple—he a graduate student in theater, and she a doctor—was poor but resolute. Risking their own lives and relying on false papers, the Abadis hid Jewish children in Catholic schools and convents and with Protestant families. In 1943, their clandestine organization—the Marcel Network—became one of the most successful operations of Jewish resistance in Europe. By the end of the war, 527 children owed their survival to the Abadis. Yet their improbable success came with almost unspeakable sacrifice. As an example of what just two people of good will can accomplish in the face of crimes against humanity, the Abadis' story is a lesson in moral and physical courage. Drawn from a multitude of sources, including hundreds of documents in the Abadis' archives and dozens of interviews with the now grown children they rescued, Fred Coleman tells the Abadis' full story for the first time.The Marcel Networkalso breaks historic ground, and reveals how the Catholic Church, French Christians, and Jews themselves did far more to save Jewish lives than is generally known.",256,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356996991l/15896466.jpg,102,4.01,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Dwight Read explores the dilemma in this engaging, thought-provoking book, taking readers through an evolutionary odyssey from our primate beginnings through the development of culture and social organization. He assesses the two major trends in this field: one that sees us as a logical culmination of primate evolution, arguing that the rudiments of culture exist in primates and even magpies, and another that views the human transition as so radical that the primate model provides no foundation for understanding human dynamics.

For Evola the physical conquest of a mountain, with all the courage, self-transcendence and mental lucidity that it entails, becomes an inseparable and complementary part of spiritual awakening. It is no coincidence that many ancient cultures chose mountains as the abodes of their gods and considered the rigorous ascent of peaks as the task of heroes and initiates.

A trio of investigators—Sergeant Jordan Stone, a military forensic expert; Father Rhun Korza, a Vatican priest; and Dr. Erin Granger, a brilliant but disillusioned archaeologist—are sent to explore the macabre discovery, a subterranean temple holding the crucified body of a mummified girl.But a brutal attack at the site sets the three on the run, thrusting them into a race to recover what was once preserved in the tomb’s sarcophagus: a book rumored to have been written by Christ’s own hand, a tome that is said to hold the secrets to His divinity. But the enemy who hounds them is like no other, a force of ancient evil directed by a leader of impossible ambitions and incalculable cunning.From crumbling tombs to splendorous churches, Erin and her two companions must confront a past that traces back thousands of years, to a time when ungodly beasts hunted the dark spaces of the world, to a moment in history when Christ made a miraculous offer, a pact of salvation for those who were damned for eternity.Here is a novel that is explosive in its revelation of a secret history.

مجموعة العبقريات الإسلامية,,['عباس محمود العقاد'],,"['Religion', 'Islam', 'Biography', 'History']","- عبقرية محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم.- عبقرية الصديق رضي الله عنه.- عبقرية عمر رضي الله عنه.- عبقرية عثمان بن عفان رضي الله عنه.- عبقرية الإمام علي رضي الله عنه.- عبقرية خالد رضي الله عنه.نبذة موقع النيل والفرات:من الصعوبة بمكان... إدراك مدى الأثر الذي تركه العقاد للحضارة العربية... فهذا المفكر الأسطورة ترك ميراثاً يستعصي إدراكه على كل ذي قدرة وفكر... عشرات بل مئات الكتب والدراسات والمقالات والأشعار... ومن عينة كتاباته السياسية التي توقفت بعد الثورة يبرز كتابه ""لا شيوعية ولا استعمار"" كعلامة حقيقية في هذا المضمار.. وتعد العبقريات أشهر ما أخرج العقاد للفكر الإسلامي وهو لم يكتب تاريخاً للأشخاص أو الوقائع فحسب... كل كان يصب الفكر في قوالب كتبه محللاً للأحداث ومواقف الشخصيات التي يتناولها عن طريق معالجته ومناقشته لأمهات الكتب التاريخية ومراجعها الكبرى...وبين يدينا كتاب جمع توليفة من كتب العبقريات وكانت البداية مع عبقرية محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، حيث تصدى العقاد في هذا الكتاب للدفاع الذي يتصدى للدفاع عن رسول الله، والذود عن شرعته، والرد على شانئيه ممن اجترأوا على مناوأته، والإتيان بالبرهان تلو البرهان على إثبات عظمته، وعظمة دعوته، وقدسية رسالته، وسمو عبقريته... لقد تناول العقاد الكشف عن عبقرية محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم في قوله وفعله، بل في سكوته وفكره، فأفاد العقاد وأجاد، واستعرض فأبدع، واستقص فأشبع، وتألقت غيرته على محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم)، في رد سهام مناوئيه إلى نحورهم، وإقحامهم في كل باطل من دعاويهم.أما في كتابه عبقرية الصديق فبدأ العقاد كتابه بالقول في تقديم كتابي هذا عن أبي بكر الصديق أقول ما قلته في ""عبقرية محمد"" و""عبقرية عمر"" وكل كتاب من هذا القبيل.وفحواه أنني لا أكتب ترجمة للصديق رضي الله عنه، ولا أكتب تاريخاً لخلافته وحوادث عصره، ولا أعني بالوقائع من حيث هي وقائع، ولا بالأخبار من حيث هي أخبار، فهذه موضوعات لم أقصدها ولم أذكر في عناوين الكتب ما يعد القارئ بها ويوجه استطلاعه إليها. ولكنما قصدت أن أرسم للصديق صورة نفسية تعرفنا به، وتجلو لنا خلائقه وبواعث أعماله، كما تجلو الصورة ملامح من تراه بالعين. فلا تعنينا الوقائع والأخبار إلا بمقدار ما تؤدي أداءها في هذا المقصد الذي لا مقصد لنا غيره... ولعل حادثاً صغيراً يستحق منا التقديم على أكبر الحوادث إذا كانت فيه دلالة نفسية أكبر من دلالته، ولمحة مصورة أظهر من لمحته. بل لعل الكلمة الموجزة التي تجيء عرضاً في المناسبات تتقدم لهذا السبب على الحوادث كبيرها وصغيرها في مقياس التاريخ"".إن ذلك النص العقادي الواضح ليحمل في طياته تبياناً واضحاً على أن مؤلف هذه العبقريات لم يقصد الكتابة التاريخية المعروفة والمتداولة، وإنما كان هدفه الحقيقي من وراء كتابته لتلك السير أمراً آخر هو الذي دفعه وألح عليه إلى أن يتناول تلك الشخصيات بذلك ""التشكيل الحر"" لو جاز لنا هذا التعبير.وبالعودة لمتن كتابة ""عبقرية الصديق"" رضي الله عنه، نجد أن العقاد قد أوفى الإمام الصديق حقه من التقدير والتوقير في هذه الدراسة بلا مراء. وأثبت لقراءة بما لا يدع مجالاً لباحث من أنه الصديق قولاً وفعلاً وعملاً في كل خلائقه وشمائله.. فهو الكريم السمح الودود.. وهو الأمين في الصداقة، والأمين في السيرة، والأمين في المال، والأمين في الإيمان، والأمين في الحكومة إلى جانب شجاعته في الرأي وفي القتال.. ثم هو في كل أولئك أكثر من الأمين.ولم يفت العقاد في هذه الدراسة أن يعالج كالعهد به العديد من صفات الصديق أبي بكر رضي الله عنه في أسلوب جزل رصين اشتهر به العقاد بين كتاب عصره. فناقش خلال صفحاته دعاوى المستشرقين وأباطيل المبطلين بالدليل الواضح والحجة البينة التي لا نملك إزاءها سوى التسليم.وقد تألق العقاد في هذه الدراسة عندما تصدى للرد على تلك الفرية الكبرى التي تقول بها بعض أعداء الإسلام بالنسبة لخلافة أبي بكر. قالت تلك الفردية: ""إن هناك اتفاقاً سابقاً ومؤامرة دبرت بين أبي بكر وعمر وأبي عبيدة ليأخذ الخلافة الأول والثاني فالثالث رضوان الله عليهم.كما تألق العقاد –كذلك- في هذه الدراسة عن الصديق أبي بكر عندما قارن بين أبي بكر وعمر في علاقتهما بالنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فأثبت بالأدلة والبراهين أن أبا بكر نموذج للإقتداء في صدر الإسلام، وعمر نموذج للاجتهاد. وكلاهما كان يحب النبي ويطيعه ويحرص على سنته، ويعجب به غاية ما في وسعه من إعجاب؟وفي كتابه عبقرية عمر، امتطى العقاد لهذا الكتاب صهوة فكره، بغية الإحاطة بعظمة بطله، فبطله ذو لون جديد، وعبقريته ذات طابع فريد، والكتاب ليس سرداً لسيرة عمر بن الخطاب، ولا عرضاً لتاريخ عصره، وإنما هو وصف له، ودراسة لأطواره، ودلالة على خصائص عظمته، واستفادة من هذه الخصائص لعلم النفس، وعلم الأخلاق، وحقائق الحياة، لذلك ركز العقاد على ما يفيد هذه الدراسة، سواء لديه أكان من حادث صغير أم عظيم. كما أظهر حرجه عندما حاول أن يجاري من يسمون بالكتّاب المنصفين، الذين يقرنون المدائح بالمعايب، ويمزجون النقائص بالمناقب، ولا يأتون بحسنة إلا نقبوا عن سيئة تمحوها، أو تقلل منها، وكأن سر حرج العقاد، أنه لم يجد عيباً ولا ما يستحق اللوم في حياة عمر وأطواره، مما جعله يتوقع أن يتهم بالمغالاة والتحيز والإعجاب، إذ كيف يحاسب-هو أو غيره-عمر بن الخطاب، وقد كان عمر يحاسب نفسه بأعنف مما كان يمكن أن يحاسبه غيره؟وسيرة عبقرية عثمان كانت المحطة الرابعة للعقاد، وسيرة عثمان ما هي إلا نمط من أنماط متعددة، زخرت بها الدعوة الإسلامية من سير الخلفاء، وغير الخلفاء كأبي عبيدة، وخالد، وسعد، وأمثالهم من الصحابة والتابعين.. ما منهم إلا من كان عظيماً بمزية، وعلماً من أعلام التاريخ...وسيرة عثمان لا تبرز لنا عبقرية كعبقرية الصديق أو الفاروق أو الإمام، وإنما تبرز لنا من جانب الأريحية صفحة لا تطوى، ولا يستطيع العقل الرشيد أن يرجع بها إلى باعث غير باعث العقيدة والإيمان.لذلك لم يكن مقتل عمر كمقتل عثمان، فبواطن الحادثين والقيم النفسية الكامنة وراءهما متباينة، لأن عمر قتل بيد دخيلة على الإسلام، وبتخطيط من خصوم الإسلام، أما عثمان... فقد قتل بأيد مسلمة، حركها وقادها الدهماء الشاغبون.ولقد تساءل الكاتب: ماذا صنعت العقيدة إذن بنفوس الحاكمين والمحكومين؟ وماذا تغير في الأمر عما عليه من فتك الجاهليين بعد قتال المؤمنين، وإيمان الكافرين؟ ولكنه استدرك بأن العقيدة لا تبطل الخلاف والنزاع، ولا تلغي الحوادث والخصومات، وإلا كانت شللاً معطلاً لحياة الأمم، ومعوقاً لمجرى التاريخ.ولا عجب إذن إن كان الناس قد ابتلوا بشرور تفوق الخصومات، إذ ليس المطلوب من العقيدة إبطالها، وإنما أن ترتفع بالنفوس عن أن تكون في غير شأن، أو شأن هزيل ضئيل، فدورها الحقيقي: إيقاظ القيم، وتحريك الهمم.وعلى هذا لم يكن مدار البحث الخصومات والأحداث، وإنما القيم والمبادئ التي دارت عليها الخصومات والأحداث.. ولقد كان مدار الخصومة، محاسبة الرعية للإمام، ومحاسبة الإمام لنفسه.وقارن الكاتب بين ما كان عليه أبناء الجاهلية والبادية وحكومات الجزيرة العربية من غمط حق المحكوم في محاسبة الحاكم، حيث كانت شرعة الحكام وقتئذ طغياناً مطلقاً من جميع القيود.. وبين ما وصلت إليه الأمور في إطار التطور إلى حد محاسبة الخليفة على كل صغيرة وكبيرة، ومن كل صغير وكبير، وهذا ما حققته العقيدة الإسلامية على أعقاب الجاهلية.. ولئن كانت المآرب الذاتية وراء كل محاسبة لعثمان، فإن هذا كان عيب الحركة، وإن لم يكن عيباً لحق المحاسبة، لأن محاسبة الحكام كانت قيمة جديدة في الصدر الأول من الإسلام، فنادى بها الخاصة والعامة، وظلت عاملاً مهماً في السياسة أيام الخلافة، وبعد أن صار الحكم ملكاً متوارثاً..ولقد بلغ عثمان الذروة في محاسبة نفسه، وتحرجة من المساس بالحياة البشرية ولو في سبيل الحفاظ على حياته، فلما أيقن القتل رفض أن يبقى في داره من يقتل أحداً ممن يحيطون به، ولما طلب منه التنحي أبى، ولم يكن إباؤه حرصاً منه على السلطان، فلا شيء أغلى من الحياة وقد هانت عليه، ولا يزعم أحد أنه غنم من الخلافة مالاً، فقد ترك الدنيا وماله دون ما كان عليه يوم استخلف، ولكنه خاف جريرة التنحي، وما سيعقب ذلك من نزاع وقتال.وعن صفات الإمام علي وعن شخصيته وعن حياته يتحدث العقاد على صفحات كتابه عبقرية الإمام علي فجاء الكتاب رائعاً بالشخصية التي تناولها وبكاتب سطورها. هذا في طهارة نشأته وعراقة أروقته، ونقاد سريرته، وعلو همته، وقوة إرادته، وغزارة علمه وثقافته، وروعة زهره وحكمته، وصدق إيمانه وشجاعته، وثباته على الحق ونصرته، وتضحيته في سبيله بروحه ومهجته... والآخر (الكاتب) في جمال عرضه، وصحة نقده، وقوة رده، وحلاوة لفظه، ودقة فهمه، وبراعة فكره، ونبل قصده...وقف لهؤلاء اللاغطين والمغالطين بالمرصاد، وتعقب كل لفظ لهم وغلط، فأظهر كيدهم ولحاجتهم وافتراءهم في ادعائهم: أن الإسلام قد قام على حد السيف، وأن محمداً كان يستهوي القتل، ويتعشق رؤية الدماء، وأن دين محمد قد أباح العبودية، وأجاز الرق، وأن تعدد زوجات محمد كان استجابة للذات حسه، وأن الإسلام قد تخطى الإنصاف في إباحته تعدد الزوجات وتوقيع العقوبة عند نشوز الزوجة، وجواز الطلاق... إلخ. واستطاع العقاد، في اقتدار وإبداع، أن يحيل مواطن التهم، كما أرادوها، إلى مواقف عظيمة، وعبقرية، وفخار هذا والذي ميز كتاب العقاد جمال عرض الموضوع، وصدق تعبير الكاتب ودقة تحليله وروعة استقصائه، وهي لا شك سمات من سمات تميز بها العقاد.وختم هذا الكتاب بعبقرية خالد حيث واصل العقاد مسيرته في سرد في سرد سير العباقرة والعظماء الذين كانت لهم مع البطولة في تاريخ الإسلام جولات، والذين كانت لهم مواقف حكمة وشجاعة سطرها لهم التاريخ، واعترف لهم بها القاصي والداني، الصديق والعدو، وعلى هذه الصفحات يروي عباس محمود العقاد سيرة واحد من هؤلاء الذين ذاع في الدنيا صيته، وعلا في التاريخ صوته، وطال في ميادين البطولة شوطه، واقترن اسمه بالنصر، فأشاع في نفوس الأعداء الفزع، وكان مجرد اختباره للقيادة مدعاة بين جنوده للثقة والطمأنينة، ومثاراً لقوة العزم وشدة الشكيمة... إنه سيف الله... خالد بن الوليد.وقد استعرض المؤلف سيرة هذا البطل: نشأته، شخصيته، إسلامه، والمعارك التي خاضها، مركزاً على أهم المنعطفات التي أبرزت عبقريته القيادية، وملقياً الضوء على علاقته بالنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، ومكانته عنده، ومما يلفت النظر في هذه السيرة أسلوب العقاد الرائع الذي يتجلى في سردياته التي تمتع بالسلاسة وبالتحليل الذي ينفذ إلى عقل القارئ وروحه. والبديع في ذلك في أن المواقف التي صورها المؤرخون على أنها مآخذ على هذا البطل.. استطاع الكاتب بفكره الدقيق، وتحليله العميق، واستقصائه الوثيق، أن يجعلها مفاخرة له، لا معايب تهز قدره أو تقلل من شأنه... وفي هذا تكمن عظمة الكاتب، وتظهر قدرته، وتبرز شخصيته، وتثبت عبقريته.",963,2007,Arabic,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1226587486l/5640388.jpg,491,4.33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues

Why Have Kids?: A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness,,['Jessica Valenti'],9780547892610,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Adult', 'Politics', 'Family', 'Self Help', 'Womens', 'Psychology']","If parenting is making Americans unhappy, if it’s impossible to “have it all,” if people don’t have the economic, social, or political structures needed to support child rearing, then why do it? And why are anxious new parents flocking to every Tiger Mother and Bébé-raiser for advice on how to raise kids?InWhy Have Kids?,Valenti explores these controversial questions through on-the-ground reporting, startling new research, and her own unique experiences as a mom. She moves beyond the black and white “mommy wars” over natural parenting, discipline, and work-life balance to explore a more nuanced reality: one filled with ambivalence, joy, guilt, and exhaustion.Would-be parents must navigate the decision to have children amidst a daunting combination of cultural expectations and hard facts. And new parents find themselves struggling to reconcile their elation with the often exhausting, confusing, and expensive business of child care. When researchers for a 2010 Pew study asked parents why they decided to have their first child, nearly 90 percent answered, for “the joy of having children.” Yet nearly every study in the last ten years shows a marked decline in the life satisfaction of those with kids.  Valenti explores this disconnect between parents’ hopes and the day-to-day reality of raising children—revealing all the ways mothers and fathers are quietly struggling. A must-read for parents as well as those considering starting a family,Why Have Kids?is an explosive addition to the conversation about modern parenthood.",208,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349156703l/13594583.jpg,"3,226",3.55,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355410-issues-in-your-tissues
