Things Grak Hates,,['Peter J. Story'],0990749304,"['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Politics', 'Literary Fiction']","Grak hates things. Lots of things. And with a peculiar intensity too.Grak’s contempt is so strong, in fact, that it often leaves his fellow tribesmen bewildered. And when attempting to describe his personality, they find themselves in need of words with greater nuance. “Neurotic” is typically used. “Sociopath” and “narcissist” are also common terms. The most popular descriptor, however, is “pathological.”Grak, on the other hand, sees his situation in a rather different light. He finds his behavior “necessary” and “selfless,” or even “benevolent” when his mood is just so. Most often, though, he simply attributes his nature to “being human.”But of all the things Grak despises, his antipathy for olives takes precedence. In his efforts to be rid of this nuisance, he gets his first taste of power and ignites a series of events with troubling consequences. Unwilling to give up his newfound influence, he sets about honing his only true talent: manipulation. But as his grip tightens, Grak’s naively selfish exterior crumbles to reveal a dark and malicious evil …In his debut work, author Peter J Story brews a robust psychological satire infused with dry humor and a pinch of emotion.

The Longest Distance,,['David      Scott'],9780991301416,[],"Part love story, part adventure mystery, part travel guide for the soul, The Longest Distance is a meditation in traveling from our heads to our hearts, and an awakening to what lies within.Shaken by tragedy in the wilds of Africa, Jeremy Braddock sets off in search of the answers to our questions about life, truth, and the all-too-trying-yet-wonderful emotion of love. From continent to continent, the protagonist takes us on a rollercoaster ride and riveting journey that reveals to us the masters, the maniacal beauty of this planet, and the greatest mystery of all––the ‘one thing’ we came here to know. As with life itself, he is not alone in this adventure, with the many supporting characters providing him with mirrored reflections of love in its varied forms, and a windowed view into his soul. Armed with his wit, his will, and an ample dose of healthy humility, our vigilant warrior attempts to summon within himself the courage we must all find to see the face of Truth, and walk the path of a higher Love.The Longest Distance evokes deeper contemplation à la Eat, Pray, Love with a level of discourse and discovery that will resonate with those who have been touched by the writings of Paulo Coehlo and Neale Donald Walsch. Interwoven within the tapestry of the novel and in between each storied tale is an uplifting dialogue with Jeremy’s higher self -- the Friend that points the way. What adds to TLD’s universal appeal is the inspirational guest appearances of a myriad of Masters – from poets to statesmen to those of the cloth – along with each chapter’s unveiling of a key ‘quality’ that, when pieced together, helps to reveal the greater picture at hand -- the Love within the love that beckons us home.The Longest Distance is a sleuth of spirit and treasure hunt of the heart that awakens our soul and provides yet another clue for the curious, a jewel for the romanticist in us all.",384,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403204269l/22537263.jpg,26,4.38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

Survivor's Guilt: The Secret Service and the Failure to Protect President Kennedy,,['Vincent Michael Palamara'],9781937584603,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'True Crime']","Painstakingly researched by an authority on the history of the Secret Service and based on primary, firsthand accounts from more than 80 former agents, White House aides, and family members, this is the definitive account of what went wrong with John F. Kennedy’s security detail on the day he was assassinated. The work provides a detailed look at how JFK could and should have been protected and debunks numerous fraudulent notions that persist about the day in question, including that JFK ordered agents off the rear of his limousine; demanded the removal of the bubbletop that covered the vehicle; and was difficult to protect and somehow, directly or indirectly, made his own tragic death easier for an assassin or assassins. This works also thoroughly investigates the threats on the president’s life before travelling to Texas; the presence of unauthorized Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination; the failure of the Secret Service in monitoring and securing the surrounding buildings, overhangs, and rooftops; and the surprising conspiratorial beliefs of several former agents.

Love Them Back to LIFE,,['Ariane Page'],1491747285,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction']","""A vibrant, eclectic sojourn into the meaning of it all..."" Kirkus ReviewsDespite new staggering technical advances, health and love seem to elude modern civilization. Why? Because we ignore a crucial element: nature’s holistic blueprint. Since human brains and psyche are expressions of it, how can we truly help humanity reach its potential? How can we help individuals be happy? Our ancestors had an intuitive grasp of this model, expressing it though their mythologies. It led psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung to find in Taoism -an example of this model- ""principles so vast that they can be applied to the entire humanity."" With the rise of a highly specialized modern science though, this encompassing vision vanished. However, as Ariane Page found, brain research results agree with this overarching model. We can assume science will therefore soon “discover” it.In her second Editor’s Choice and IndieFab finalist book ""Love Them Back to LIFE"", Ariane Page invites us to journey through this holistic blueprint and witness how we allow or prevent it from unfolding harmoniously in our personal lives. She takes us on a discovery journey through this model expressed by the human brain as she focuses on love. Love is the tool used by this model, the LIFE (Law Inherent to the Five Elements), to lead us toward a conscious coherence between our physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual realities, a holism necessary to truly feel alive, happy, and loved.",432,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412352082l/23301898.jpg,18,4.83,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

""Dr. Tsipursky shows how modern research in fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide demonstrable strategies that allow us to create a purpose - our own purpose,"" according to Dr. Bo Bennett, a Doctor of Psychology and author of Logically Fallacious. Those who read draft versions gained much from their experience. ""Its research-based strategies for evaluating one's purpose and meaning have helped me develop a clearer vision for my future. I am currently pursuing a new set of goals - both personally and professionally - that align with my values,"" in the words of John Johnson.Science really can answer life's big questions, such as ""why am I here,"" as shown by a wave of recent research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and medicine. The research highlights that such questions are vital, since people who lack a rich sense of purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose comes from traditional sources such as cultural heritage and religion. While this guidance works for some, unfortunately traditional sources of meaning and purpose do not speak nearly so well to others who want an evidence-based approach in which they can be truly confident. This workbook offers science-based strategies and data-driven tools to help you improve your mental and physical health by finding the meaning of your life and thus living with a purpose.Read this book to find your purpose using science!",121,2015,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439955589l/25878671._SY475_.jpg,48,4.1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

Not Just Yet. Egypt 2011: News - Incidents - Causes,,['Mohamed Abdel-Maksoud'],9789776767,"['Northern Africa', 'Egypt']","ForewordBeginning in December 2010, a series of revolutions and rebellions rocked the Middle East. Today, this series of events is known as the Arab Spring. In January 2011, these events spread to Egypt, where they sparked the Egyptian revolution.For 18 days, protests rocked Egypt. This is where the story begins.This story will follow the events of one man as told through the digital trails one leaves on using today's technology. His emails, tweets, and blog posts will all be used in order to follow his story both during the actual revolution and in the subsequent year.During this time, the president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was forced to step down from his position. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), head of the military in Egypt, dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. SCAF took over the country for six months until elections could be held. Political parties were in chaos; no one knew who could replace Mubarak. The only large organized force was the Muslim Brotherhood, an international group that had existed in Egypt since 1928, and enjoyed relative freedom under Mubarak's rule.Technically, elections had occurred in Egypt for a long time at this point. But Mubarak had ruled for thirty years, due to corruption, coercion, and manipulation of the elections. During his rule, many Egyptians lived well below the poverty level. Corruption was prevalent in the government, which groups opposing Mubarak had already been pointing out well before the revolution.The elections following the revolution were regarded by many as the first true chance for democratic elections within Egypt. It was not only the new president that would be elected in the elections. There would be new parliament members and those who started the uprising Egypt felt like they had a chance to achieve the change they dreamed of from the Parliament. If you’ve read the news about Egypt since the revolution, you know that this is not what happened. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people did not support radical change to a new democracy, and opted instead to support the familiar traditional powers: the old regime and the Muslim Brotherhood.After a brief time in rule, the Muslim Brotherhood's man in presidency was ousted following popular protests, and the head of military was appointed as a president. In many ways, Egypt is back to where it was before.The stories from the revolution are therefore important in that they shed light on the actual events during that critical year that lead to the disappointing outcomes. The book goes beyond the mere narration of events and tries to find the causes of why things went as they did. The causes date back much older than one might imagine.In this story, we look back in time at the struggle for freedom through the eyes of one unnamed man. As you follow his story, keep in mind the events that have happened since, and keep in mind what is yet to come.---Foreword by Jill Waller.Cover art by Smo Sienkiewicz.",76,2019,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547214474l/43537359._SX318_.jpg,17,4.53,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

The Black Widows,,['Jane Finch'],1497300290,[],"Readers' Favorite Five Star Review:The Black Widows by Jane Finch is a fictitious thriller about three women who plan and plot the deaths of their ruthless, wealthy husbands. How could these women be so unscrupulous? Was it greed or revenge? As their painful childhood truths unfold, I couldn’t help but empathize with Finch’s characters, Jessica, Caprice, and Suzannah. Like the spider weaving her web, the author spins three well-developed stories of love, loss, death, betrayal and triumph. These women are true examples of narcissists, and this book is not your normal run of the mill thriller. I couldn’t put the book down until I found out what happened next. “Never underestimate a woman scorned.”Through the eyes of Jane Finch, The Black Widows should have you scrambling to get your worldly affairs in order. The author beckons us on with page after page of murderous incidents that left me shaking my head and pondering the meaning of Karma as the plot thickens for these three villainesses - Jessica, Caprice and Suzannah - who seem to get away with murder for decades, or have they? While reading this novel, I felt as though I was looking into the mind of psychological killers via a peephole. Just when I thought the story was over, the author provides historical articles with true crimes of passion and their outcomes. A welcome surprise, and definitely not the ending I expected for these Black Widows. Welcome to the world of adult fiction.

Untitled Document: The Mystery Unfolds,,['Sufyan Sher'],,[],"Ever since humans have dwelt on Earth, they have been stuck in this mainstream ideology of life: life is hard, things don't work as they should, and the reason everything is happening is because that's how everything should be happening, and we have little to no control over any of it. In his book Untitled Document: The Mystery Unfolds, the author contradicts the above statements by declaring that change is important for the growth of humanity as a species; not just change in general. Through this book he aims to change the way humans think about and perceive situations. The book has many co-relative events and theories which are still mysterious to humans, with few or no explanations for why these things happen or have happened. This book sails through various genres of content; from storytelling to insightful theorizing to fictional writing.

Alternating between the Deep South and New York City during the 1960s and early '70s,They Come in All Colorsfollows a biracial teenage boy who finds his new life in the big city disrupted by childhood memories of the summer when racial tensions in his hometown reached a tipping point.It's 1968 when fourteen-year-old Huey Fairchild begins high school at Claremont Prep, one of New York City’s most prestigious boys’ schools. His mother had uprooted her family from their small hometown of Akersburg, Georgia, a few years earlier, leaving behind Huey’s white father and the racial unrest that ran deeper than the Chattahoochee River.But for our sharp-tongued protagonist, forgetting the past is easier said than done. At Claremont, where the only other nonwhite person is the janitor, Huey quickly realizes that racism can lurk beneath even the nicest school uniform. After a momentary slip of his temper, Huey finds himself on academic probation and facing legal charges. With his promising school career in limbo, he begins examining his current predicament at Claremont through the lens of his childhood memories of growing up in Akersburg during the Civil Rights Movement—and the chilling moments leading up to his and his mother's flight north.With Huey’s head-shaking antics fueling this coming-of-age narrative, the story triumphs as a tender and honest exploration of race, identity, family, and homeland.",336,2018,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527540506l/35297311._SY475_.jpg,267,3.47,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

No one is safe.Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground.

When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected.

At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror.

Economics in One Lesson,,['Henry Hazlitt'],9781933550213,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Currency', 'Money', 'Classics', 'Audiobook']","Here is a publishing event: the new Mises Institute edition of the classic book that has taught many millions sound economic thinking. It is a hardbound volume, priced very low thanks to special benefactors, and now available in quantity discounts for distribution to your friends, family, and anyone you meet who needs to understand what economics implies for the society, government, and civilization.Henry Hazlitt wrote this book following his stint at the New York Times as an editorialist. His hope was to reduce the whole teaching of economics to a few principles and explain them in ways that people would never forget. It worked. He relied on some stories by Bastiat and his own impeccable capacity for logical thinking and crystal-clear prose.He was writing under the influence of Mises himself, of course, but he brought his own special gifts to the project. As just one example, this is the book that made the idea of the ""broken window fallacy"" so famous.What thrills us in particular about this new edition is that it is beautiful, it is hardcover, and it is newly typeset for modern readers. It has a full index. It includes a wonderful foreword by Walter Block. It's the right size, shape, and feel – perfect for making this book central to all educational efforts of the future.This is the book to send to reporters, politicians, pastors, political activists, teachers, or anyone else who needs to know.Professor Block explains that it was this book that turned him on to economics as a science. He believes that it is probably the most important economics book ever written in the sense that it offers the greatest hope to educating everyone about the meaning of the science.Written for the non-academic, it has served as the major antidote to fallacies in the popular press, and has appeared in dozens of languages and printings. It's still the quickest way to learn how to think like an economist. And this is why it has been used in the best classrooms more than sixty years.Many writers have since attempted to beat this book as an introduction, but have never succeeded.

With Europe on the brink of World War Two, Stefan and his family pray they'll survive in their uncertain world. They long to be free. (In 1932-33, as part of their drive towards industrialisation, the Soviet Union demanded impossibly high requisitions of grain from rural areas in Ukraine. In a deliberate act of genocide, Ukrainian smallholdings were stripped of food, and the population began to perish, with some estimates as high as 10 million deaths, from starvation. In Ukraine, this atrocity became known as the Holodomor (death by hunger). The following years saw Soviet purges and terrors resulting in the elimination of academics and intellectuals, or of anyone who spoke out against Soviet rule. When World War Two arrived on Ukraine's doorstep, many people viewed the Nazis as liberators - a view that was quickly proved wrong.

This fantastically visionary story, much like the Zen Koans, deals with states of mind rather than words. Huikai says: ""Unless this is understood, the point of the classic will be missed. The whole intent was to help the pupil break the shell of his limited mind and attain a second eternal birth, satori, enlightenment.""What the book achieves is something very refreshing and very original. It offers no teaching yet points towards an answer to life that is rarely perceived. ""Life is the answer"", Clark says. ""The answer to all our seeking remains hidden all the time while we are looking for it.""Told in four parts:The First Awakening,The Sleeping,The DreamingandThe Reawakening, The Garden mirrors the Mandukya Upanishad:Three States and One Reality[an exposition of the principle of Aum as consisting of three elements: a, u, m, which may be used to experience the soul itself. It contains twelve verses that delineate four levels of consciousness: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and a fourth mystical state of being one with the soul. It is said that this Upanishad alone is enough to lead one to spiritual liberation].The condensed narrative of this spiritual love story is so designed that each reader will want to think about the words over and again, through a sustained process of inner reflection. It is a meditation on the ""Unborn Mind"" -- the birthless, deathless, timeless, spaceless, boundless awareness that is our real identity.

This is the light that shines in your heart. --Chandogya UpanishadWe are voyagers, set on a course to find our unique purpose in life. In our heart lies the key to true peace and happiness. Each of the twenty-five chapters presents a voyage toward our inner, True Self, bringing a deeper and wider perspective along the way. Exploring the shores of human-beingness ever more deeply, we realise Soul is the lighthouse -- the light that guides us safely home. By simply experiencing ourselves without distraction of mind, we see through personal drama to our inner true nature. We are all connected in the still ocean of pure awareness.It is only the mind which appears as the world and as bondage; there is no world other than the mind. On inquiry, this mind turns out to be nothing more than ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness. --The Ribhu GitaPure awareness is an art that requires practice to quiet the surface of mind and still the moving waters of our emotional seas.

"N*gga Theory: Race, Language, Unequal Justice, and the Law",,['Jody Armour'],9781940660684,"['Race', 'Nonfiction', 'Social Movements', 'Social Justice', 'Politics', 'Law']","Racialized mass incarceration is not just cell blocks brimming with black bodies. It’s a pervasive and deep-seated way of talking and thinking about morality, law, and politics in matters of blame and punishment; it’s a punitive impulse and retributive urge that runs so strong and deep in most Americans that taming it will take a revolution in consciousness.Through radical critiques of conventional morality, conventional legal theory, and conventional politics in criminal justice matters, this book fuels this revolution. Drawing on the phenomenon moral philosophers call moral luck, Armour’s book humanizes these most otherized, monsterized criminals by challenging the wide-spread belief that there is a deep and wide moral gulf between “them” and law-abiding, noncriminal, nonviolent “us.” Legally, N*gga Theory roots out where bias lives in the black letter law and adjudication of just deserts; that is, it shows how murderers and other morally condemnable criminals are not merely “found” in criminal trials like discoverable facts of nature, but rather they are socially constructed, often by racially biased prosecutors, judges, and jurors. And politically, Armour both examines and exemplifies the way a transgressive word or symbol, like the troublesome and disreputable N-word itself, can, when wielded with care and precision by critical black writers and artists, signal a sharp rejection of respectability politics, promote political solidarity with the most reviled black criminals, and spark a revolution in consciousness about racialized mass incarceration.",384,2020,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1588342238l/53306710.jpg,43,4.35,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

It is the story of Lilith, born into slavery on a Jamaican sugar plantation at the end of the eighteenth century. Even at her birth, the slave women around her recognize a dark power that they and she will come to both revere and fear.The Night Women, as they call themselves, have long been plotting a slave revolt, and as Lilith comes of age and reveals the extent of her power, they see her as the key to their plans. But when she begins to understand her own feelings and desires and identity, Lilith starts to push at the edges of what is imaginable for the life of a slave woman in Jamaica, and risks becoming the conspiracy's weak link.Lilith's story overflows with high drama and heartbreak, and life on the plantation is rife with dangerous secrets, unspoken jealousies, inhuman violence, and very human emotion between slave and master, between slave and overseer, and among the slaves themselves. Lilith finds herself at the heart of it all.

Twice she returns to China to reunite with her mother as well as friends, and to see how Chinese society and politics are evolving. However, as an escaped citizen who has returned with an American passport, Nina puts herself in dangerous situations and finds herself needing to flee from the red terror once again.“Zoe S. Roy’s novel, Calls Across the Pacific, is a fascinating journey of a young woman, Nina Huang, whose adventure begins during the Cultural Revolution in China, follows her immigration to the United States, and eventually leads her to a new life in Canada. The story entwines the intimacy of a memoir and the panoramic sweep of eyewitness history, enmeshing us in the challenges of breaking away not only from the violent persecution of communism, but also from the oppressive moral norms of a tradition bound China. This courageous tale of perseverance in the face of adversity is a timeless rendering of the never ending quest for transformation and beauty.”—Bianca Lakoseljac, author of Summer of the Dancing Bear“With Calls Across the Pacific, Zoë Roy continues to plumb her firsthand knowledge of everyday life in Maoist China. Her experience of this endlessly fascinating era, combined with a talent for detailed, humorous and sometimes heartbreaking storytelling, makes for a fine novel which delights and informs in equal measure.

BREAKING THE WHITE CODE OF SILENCE, A COLLECTION OF PERSONAL NARRATIVES, is a collection that asks just that. While the literature on whiteness has long been dominated by an academic point of view, editors Gabrielle David and Sean Frederick Forbes came to the realization that there was an unmet need for an anthology of personal narratives about race and culture from the perspective of white Americans. In this conception process, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? was born.The first of its kind, this collection of 82 personal narratives reflects a vibrant range of stories from white Americans who speak frankly and openly about race, not only as it applies to people of color, but as it applies to themselves. In answering the question, some may offer viewpoints one may not necessarily agree with, but nevertheless, it is clear that each contributor is committed to answering it as honestly as possible.With an introduction by racial justice educator and writer, Debby Irving, and an afterword by award-winning poet, author and scholar, Tara Betts, the purpose of WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? is to, as Irving points out in her introduction, break the code of silence so that we can engage in frank conversations about race. An invaluable starting point that includes a glossary and a bibliography of suggested reading, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? is highly recommended for students, teachers and anyone else interested in seeking a deeper and richer understanding of race in America.

We wake up in a haze—often after hitting snooze a few times. Then we rush around to get ready and out the door so we can officially start the day. Before we know it, hours have slipped by without us accomplishing anything beyond downing a cup of coffee, dashing off a few emails, and dishing with our coworkers around the water cooler. By the time the workday wraps up, we’re so exhausted and defeated that any motivation to accomplish something in the evening has vanished.But according to time management expert Laura Vanderkam, mornings hold the key to taking control of our schedules. If we use them wisely, we can build habits that will allow us to lead happier, more productive lives.Drawing on real-life anecdotes and scientific research that shows why the early hours of the day are so important, Vanderkam reveals how successful people use mornings to help them accomplish things that are often impossible to take care of later in the day. While many of us are still in bed, these folks are scoring daily victories to improve their health, careers, and personal lives without sacrificing their sanity. For instance, former PepsiCo chairman and CEO Steve Reinemund would rise at 5:00 a.m., run four miles, pray, and eat breakfast with his family before heading to work to run a Fortune 500 company.What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast is a fun, practical guide that will inspire you to rethink your morning routine and jump-start your life before the day has even begun.",181,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384803510l/18634501.jpg,"10,285",3.4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

Lost in Infinity,,['Travis Besecker'],9781469973463,[],"This book is not for everyone.'Lost in Infinity' is a novel that many readers will find hard to define. In fact, it's much easier to list what it is most definitely not, than what it really is. It's not necessarily a tale of suspense or a thriller. It's not a mystery by normal standards. It's not inspirational, romantic or full of laughs. Depending upon your perspective and final take on the tale, it's not even entirely fiction.This book is not for everyone. 'Lost in Infinity' is a novel intended for a very specific audience…The author would have you believe this is a ""psychological roller coaster wrapped in the factual memoir of a chronic insomniac suffering from apeirophobia (the fear of infinity)."" He would go on to explain that the ""novel unfolds the history of his life as he tries to unlock repressed memories through a near schizophrenic relationship with his own splintered subconscious."" This is a clever ruse to suck in his niche reader. This book is not for everyone.Influenced by Chuck Palahniuk, Kurt Vonnegut and Carlton Mellick III, the novel offers a unique look into the private confessions of a self-absorbed blogger on the precipice of a mental breakdown. The recurring theme of déjà vu leads you through the work giving glimpses of a dark past while offering anecdotes that will eerily relate to most readers. Mixing in humor and satire with a confused childhood spent under the microscope of therapists keeps the mood light while he digs deeper into his past looking for the root of his problems. The narrator pulls back the curtain and reveals his dark inner turmoil as he fears a slow deliberate path toward schizophrenia. A repetition of events and recollections leads the reader through the twisted break the author fears while touching on life's everyday issues and questions. He delves into sleepless nights, stress, relationships and the pitfalls of higher education while he openly offers opinions on religion, suicide, insomnia, depression and the meaning of life.Many casual readers will be turned off by the jumping timeline. Some will be confused by the author's back and forth focus on his missing memories. The first person pseudo-oral narrative will leave others simply frustrated. The rest will grow sick of the author's defense mechanisms, most often hiding behind his pretentious recollections of growing up a childhood 'genius'. This book is not for everyone.Now that you've been properly warned and many have moved on to their next light read…'Lost in Infinity' is part social commentary, part psychological mystery and part diary. What begins as an egotistical journal from an overconfident, yet anti-social, bratty blogger slowly dissolves into the twisted chaos of a mind on the brink of collapse. The reader is eventually forced to decide if the book is a cry for help from a man attempting to rationalize his schizophrenia or a clever ruse to make them stop and contemplate the meaning of existence. 'Lost in Infinity' will leave the reader questioning everything they thought they knew about the author's sanity, about their own life, about existence and the infinite universe beyond.",424,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332771422l/13561541.jpg,58,3.72,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

Bagley chronicles the sisters’ early education together at the Crossroads School and later at the progressive Lincoln School in Marion. She describes Coretta’s burgeoning talent for singing and her devotion to musical studies, and the sisters’ experiences matriculating at Antioch College, an all-white college far from the rural South. Bagley provides vivid insights into Coretta’s early passion for racial and economic justice, which lead to her involvement in the Peace Movement and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.As Coretta’s older sister, Edythe shared in almost all of Coretta’s many trials and tribulations.Desert Rosecharts Coretta’s hesitance about her romance with Martin Luther King and the prospect of having to sacrifice her dream of a career in music to become a minister’s wife. Ultimately, Coretta chose to utilize her artistic gifts and singing voice for the Movement through the development and performance of Freedom Concerts. This book also charts Coretta’s own commitment and dedication, in the years that followed King’s death, to the causes of international civil rights, the antiapartheid movement, and the establishment of the King Center in Atlanta and the national King Holiday. Coretta’s devotion to activism, motherhood, and the movement led by her husband, and her courageous assumption of the legacy left in the wake of King’s untimely assassination, are wonderfully detailed in this intimate biography.",336,2011,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344681095l/13309364.jpg,41,4.24,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs and early medieval historical traditions. While some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of the tales is the product of a developed medieval Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written.Lady Charlotte Guest in the mid 19th century was the first to publish English translations of the collection, popularising the name ""Mabinogion"". The stories appear in either or both of two medieval Welsh manuscripts, theWhite Book of RhydderchorLlyfr Gwyn Rhydderch, written c.1350, and theRed Book of HergestorLlyfr Coch Hergest, written c.1382 – 1410, tho texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later mss.Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing mss, but disagree over just how much older. The different texts originated at different times. Debate has focused on the dating of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Sir Ifor Williams offered a date prior to 1100, based on linguistic and historical arguments, while later Saunders Lewis set forth a number of arguments for a date between 1170 and 1190; Th Charles-Edwards, in a paper published in 1970, discussed both viewpoints, and while critical of the arguments of both scholars, noted that the language of the stories fits the 11th century.

Romantic and sometimes intimate, they leave their own footsteps in the rural and industrial landscape of today which resonate our profound need to love and be loved, a need that transcends all attempts to homogenise us into one cultural identity.In these poems romance, chivalry and passion come to life. The Ranger's mind enjoys its exile in the golden forest of Lothlorien wandering through the Pre Raphaelite images. His mythical and mystical ideals, fuse with our thirst for realism and the alienation of pod life in this matrix of Metropolis.Love is more than a singles bar at the end of a hard working week. It is real and tangible, and like life, it makes mistakes. In these poems of love remembered, love now and love to be, exile ends and life begins again.By Connie Calomeni, Poet 21-Sep-2012 on lulu.comThe poems in this collection show Strider’s gift of being able to weave words into creative and surprising configurations.

Standing a few feet from President Obama, I warned my fellow citizens of the dangers facing our country and called for a return to the principles that made America great.Many Americans heard and responded, but our nation’s decline has continued. Today the danger is greater than ever before, and I have never shared a more urgent message than I do now. Our growing debt and deteriorating morals have driven us far from the founders’ intent. We’ve made very little progress in basic education. Obamacare threatens our health, liberty, and financial future. Media elitism and political correctness are out of control. Worst of all, we seem to have lost our ability to discuss important issues calmly and respectfully regardless of party affiliation or other differences. As a doctor rather than a politician, I care about what works, not whether someone has an (R) or a (D) after his or her name. We have to come together to solve our problems.Knowing that the future of my grandchildren is in jeopardy because of reckless spending, godless government, and mean-spirited attempts to silence critics left me no choice but to write this book. I have endeavored to propose a road out of our decline, appealing to every American’s decency and common sense. If each of us sits back and expects someone else to take action, it will soon be too late. But with your help, I firmly believe that America may once again be “one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”Sincerely,Ben Carson",256,2014,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408309119l/18667884.jpg,"3,724",4.09,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

The Proximity of Stars,,['Benedict Stuart'],1717533027,['Science Fiction'],"BlurbHave you ever wondered if we choose our loved ones during our lifetime? Before or after that time? Do you ponder the meaning of your existence? Your destiny? What life would be like if your enemies or rivals didn’t exist at all?Brian Sunderland, whom some might call a “profound researcher,” has been looking for answers to these questions.

Anti-Matter,,['Michael Mathiesen'],9781718903951,[],"Some people say that money, bad luck or Karma is the cause of all your problems. But, now we know that it is not money or bad luck or even Karma that is the cause of your fate - it's Anti-Matter. Truth is indeed stranger than Fiction. Anti-Matter is both a love story and a classic Science Fiction story that reveals exactly how our fate is created not by us as individuals, but by how we maneuver through the universe and all of the powerful forces that it creates just to mess with us. The story of the creator of the Anti-Matter Ray gun will astound and amaze you. When the Anti-Matter bomb hits the planet, everything goes topsy-turvy Up is Down. Left is Right and inside is out. We now know that Anti-Matter is made in thunderstorms here on Earth in quantities sufficient to change lives. It is also made inside Black Holes, stars that have become so massive that nothing can escape, not even light and this is why they are Black Holes. Ever since this amazing stuff was discovered floating around in the universe scientists have been struggling to find out what impact anti-matter might be having on our world. In this amazing new Science Fiction adventure, you not only find out how anti-matter works in our world, but also how it may be impacting your life right now at this very moment. When any particle of anti-matter comes into contact with the normal matter that we all take for granted, the air we breathe, our bodies, our cars, our houses, our clothing, etc. the two opposite types of matter annihilate one another instantly. If anti-matter hits your brain, your thinking is going to be severely altered. Your future may be changed as well, since your future is greatly dependent upon what you're thinking at any given time. Every aspect of our thinking, every aspect of our daily lives is powered by the atomic structure of matter. The atoms, as we know, like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc. are the major components of molecules. Molecules are what we are composed of that moves our bodies, helps us breathe, digests our food, allows us to think. In any of these processes, especially when we fall in love, we don't want too much interference from anyone or anything, and we may be able to defend against alot of things. But we have no defenses against anti-matter. So, when we ourselves come into contact with anti-matter, parts of ourselves vanish, disappear, it is annihilated. How much of this anti-matter/matter annihilation is required before serious damage is done, no one knows. This is a story about a group of people who have more than enough anti-matter in their lives to change their lives drastically several times over. This is the story of the inventor of the anti-matter ray and what happened after his ray gun was introduced to the world. This is the story of the inventor of the Anti-Matter Ray and what happened after his ray gun was introduced to the world. The amazing twists and turns will amaze and entertain and cause great consternation in your life if you have ever encountered an event in your life that you could not explain. Now, you will be able to put it down to Anti-Matter. This story is not meant for the squeamish or the mentally challenged. This is a story that will literally annihilate your present conception of what reality means and it may even help you discover a better universe in which you are meant to live and breathe in. If you thought you knew just about everything regarding what happens in this universe - if you thought you knew just about everything that was going to happen to you in the next twenty-four hours - guess again. Anti-matter is out there, and there's more and more of it sneaking into our world every day. An anti-matter storm rages all around us every day and is causing the greatest chaos this world has ever known. If you have seen that Truth is truly stranger than fiction - then you need to read this book.",364,2018,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531146322l/40703476.jpg,6,5.0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

A brilliant but troubled Bangladeshi physics student searches for balance, acceptance, and his own extraordinary destiny after his father disappears. When a Halloween blizzard immobilizes Minneapolis, a young woman is forced to confront the snow-bound nature of her own relationships and emotions. During an excursion to an idyllic swimming hole hidden in the Black Hills, two old friends unexpectedly compete for the affections of an irresistible, though married, Lakota woman. Like a mythical expedition to reach the horizon or the quest to distill truth from the beauty around us, the revelation confirmed by these imaginative stories - elegant, sometimes jarring, always wonderfully absurd - is that the very act of reaching is itself a form of touch.“The quiet plains of the North Country serve as a perfect backdrop for Parsons’ moving debut, a collection of short stories whose characters often live deeply solitary, if not always lonely, lives.”-- Kirkus Reviews (starred review)“Eloquently written and replete with a continual stream of un-hackneyed twists and turns, Parsons’ collection is superbly crafted.

He enlists the aid of her twin sister, Beka, who is a captain in the Guardians, a branch of the Galactic Defense Forces responsible for pursuing criminals. Past animosity between the sisters ensures that there will be no cooperation between the two, and that Rena will find no allies in her sister's squad.

In highly readable, first-person style, Mason’s writing stimulates readers’ thoughts and prayers and propels couples to deeper intimacy. “A marriage is not a joining of two worlds,” says the author, “but an abandoning of two worlds in order that one new one might be formed.” Rich chapters on “Otherness,” “Vows,” “Intimacy,” “Sex,” “Submission,” and an all-new chapter on “Oneness” lift readers to view the eternal, spiritual nature of this faith-filled, “impossible,” wild—yet wonderful—frontier.“An outstanding achievement. Rarely has a book aroused in me so much enthusiasm as has the combination of wisdom, depth, dignity, and glow that I find in these chapters.”-J.I. Packer“Absolutely exquisite. It reaches down deep into our innermost being, revealing, revitalizing, rewarding. A real classic.”-Gigi Graham Tchividjian“A drop everything book. Mason deals with the stunning paradoxes of the mystery, the problems, and the glories of marriage. I don’t need to read any other book on the subject.”-Elisabeth ElliotStory Behind the Book""Over the twenty years since its publication, many couples have told me that they’ve read my book aloud to each other. This always amazes me and gives me great joy. I’m also amazed that many single people have read it. Either way, my goal is for hearts to be warmed by the mystery of divine love. I want couples to enter into deeper intimacy by thinking together about themystery of marriage—about how their love, besides being a gift of God, reflects the very love He has for Himself in the Trinity. For God is not a bachelor, and throughout the Bible marriage is a supreme picture of the nature of God’s love and of His kingdom. I want people who read my book to feel so soaked in these wonderful, divine mysteries that it deepens their reverence for marriage and inspires them to greater love.""-Mike Mason",224,1985,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396003387l/156886.jpg,887,4.24,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer
The Enemy Within,,['Sheila L. Jackson'],9781684114382,[],"Have you ever wondered why as Christians we sometimes do not act as though we are? The Enemy Within will illustrate how we wrestle with the decisions between good and evil; how we want to do the right thing but feel as though there is someone else-our sinful nature-forcing us to do that which is evil. ""The Enemy Within"" exposes the power struggles that we have between the flesh and the spirit man within us.

Ramayana,,['Vālmīki'],,"['Fantasy', 'Mythology']","The Ramayana is, quite simply, the greatest of Indian epics - and one of the world's supreme masterpieces of storytelling 'Almost every individual living in India,' writes R. K. Narayan in the Introduction to this new interpretation, 'is aware of the story of The Ramayana. Everyone of whatever age, outlook, education or station in life knows the essential part of the epic and adores the main figures in it - Rama and Sita. Every child is told the story at bedtime . . . The Ramayana pervades our cultural life.' Although the Sanskrit original was composed by Valmiki, probably around the fourth century BC, poets have produced countless variant versions in different languages. Here, drawing his inspiration from the work of an eleventh-century Tamil poet called Kamban, Narayan has used the talents of a master novelist to recreate the excitement and joy he has found in the original.

The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence.But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana has never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed castes of India for 3000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak.“For thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the Gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor’s tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.”“I am a non-entity – invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama – the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.”The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour – Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed from them. It is then that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.",504,2012,English,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332909772l/13563459.jpg,"12,069",3.68,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/652074.The_Swimmer

The always funny, frank, and down-to-earth medium—whether she’s talking to her family, the local butcher, or the souls of those who’ve passed on—began communicating with Spirit at the age of four, but didn’t fully accept her gift until she was thirty-three years old.

Since then she’ s used her extraordinary gift to help people heal from the loss of their loved ones.Theresa feels that it’s her purpose to make us all aware that there is more to life than what we see here in the physical world.
